Introduction
------------

PacketFence is a fully supported, trusted, Free and Open Source network access control (NAC) system. Boosting an impressive feature set including a captive portal for registration and remediation, centralized wired and wireless management, 802.1X support, layer-2 isolation of problematic devices, integration with IDS, vulnerability scanners and firewalls; PacketFence can be used to effectively secure networks - from small to very large heterogeneous networks. For a more detailed presentation on PacketFence please visit https://packetfence.org.

System Requirements
-------------------

Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence reuses many components in an infrastructure. Nonetheless, it will install the following ones and manage them itself:

[options="compact"]
* database server (MariaDB)
* web server (Apache)
* DHCP server (PacketFence)
* RADIUS server (FreeRADIUS)
* firewall (iptables)

In this guide, we assume that all those components are running on the same server (i.e., "localhost" or "127.0.0.1") that PacketFence will be installed on.

Good understanding of those underlying components and GNU/Linux is required to install PacketFence. When installing PacketFence, all these components will be properly installed. Moreover, PacketFence will manage the services listed above. Make sure that all the other services are automatically started by your operating system.

Minimum Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following provides a list of the minimum server hardware recommendations:

[options="compact"]
* Intel or AMD CPU 3 GHz, 2 CPU cores
* 12 GB of RAM (16 GB recommended)
* 100 GB of disk space (RAID-1 recommended)
* 1 network card (2 recommended)

Operating System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports the following operating systems on the x86_64 architecture:

[options="compact"]
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x Server
* Community ENTerprise Operating System (CentOS) 7.x
* Debian 9.0 (Stretch)

Make sure that you can install additional packages from your standard distribution. For example, if you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you have to be subscribed to the Red Hat Network before continuing with the PacketFence software installation.

Other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu are known to work but this document does not cover them.


Installation
------------

This section will guide you through the installation of PacketFence from the Zero Effort NAC (ZEN) appliance and from the standard repository of packages we provide - which can be used to install PacketFence on top of a vanilla GNU/Linux installation.

Installing PacketFence from the ZEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ZEN (Zero Effort NAC) edition of PacketFence allows you to rapidly get PacketFence running in your network environment. It consists of a fully installed and preconfigured version of PacketFence distributed as a virtual appliance. It can be deployed on VMware ESX/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V and other products. This section covers the deployment of the virtual appliance on VMware-based products. We are not supporting any Xen-based hypervisors yet.

Virtual Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This setup has been tested using VMware ESXi, Fusion and Workstation products with 12 GB of RAM dedicated to the virtual machine. It might work using other VMware products.  To properly run the PacketFence virtual appliance, you need a CPU that supports long mode. In other words, you need to have a 64-bit capable CPU on your host. PacketFence ZEN comes in a pre-built virtual disk (OVF). If you are using an ESX type hypervisor, you need to import the OVF using vSphere Client (or vCenter).

The virtual appliance passwords are:

.Management (SSH/Console) and MariaDB
* Login: root
* Password: p@ck3tf3nc3

.Captive Portal / 802.1X Registration User
* Login: demouser
* Password: demouser


Import to ESX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that there is only one virtual network card created, and also make sure that your vEthernet is connected to a virtual switch (vSwitch). That virtual network card will be used as the PacketFence management interface.

Import to VMware Player/Workstation for Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Newer version of VMware Player handles the VLAN trunking a lot better.  Having that said, we can use a single interface on the VM.  So, you need to ensure that your VM host is plugged into a physical trunk port with VLAN 1,2,3,5,10 and 200 as the allowed VLAN. These VLANs will be used later in configuration examples.


=== Installing PacketFence on existing Linux

PacketFence provides packages repository for RHEL / CentOS as well as packages repository fo Debian.

These repositories contain all required dependencies to install PacketFence. This provides numerous advantages. Among them, there are:

[options="compact"]
* easy installation
* everything is packaged as RPM and Debian packages
* easy upgrade

First install your supported distribution with minimal installation and no additional packages. Then:

On Red Hat-based systems
[options="compact"]
* Disable firewall
* Disable SELinux

On Debian
[options="compact"]
* Disable AppArmor
* Disable resolvconf

Make sure your system is up to date and your yum or apt-get database is updated. On a RHEL-based system, do:

[source,bash]
----
yum update
----

On a Debian system, do:

[source,bash]
----
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
----

Regarding SELinux or AppArmor, even if they may be wanted by some
organizations, PacketFence will not work properly if SELinux or AppArmor are
enabled. You will need to explicitly disable SELinux from the
`/etc/selinux/config` file and reboot the machine. For AppArmor, you need to
follow instructions on
link:https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse#Disable_AppArmor[Debian wiki].

Regarding resolvconf, you can remove the symlink to that file and simply create the `/etc/resolv.conf` file with the content you want.

==== RHEL / CentOS based systems

NOTE: Applies to CentOS and Scientific Linux but only the x86_64 architecture is supported.

Install kernel development package:

[source,bash]
----
yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
----

===== RHEL 7.x

NOTE: These are extra steps are required for RHEL 7 systems only, excluding derivatives such as CentOS or Scientific Linux.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux users need to take an additional setup step. If you are not using the RHN Subscription Management from Red Hat you need to enable the optional and extras channels by running the following as root:

[source,bash]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----

==== Debian based systems

Install kernel development package:

[source,bash]
----
apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
----

==== Software Installation

===== RHEL / CentOS based systems

In order to use the PacketFence repository:

[source,bash]
----
yum localinstall http://packetfence.org/downloads/PacketFence/RHEL7/packetfence-release-7.stable.noarch.rpm
----

Once the repository is defined, you can install PacketFence with all its
dependencies, and the required external services (database
server, DHCP server, RADIUS server) using:

[source,bash]
----
yum install --enablerepo=packetfence packetfence
----

===== Debian based systems

In order to use the repository, create a file named [filename]`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/packetfence.list`:

[source,bash]
----
echo 'deb http://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/debian stretch stretch' > \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/packetfence.list
----

Once the repository is defined, you can install PacketFence with all its
dependencies, and the required external services (Database
server, DHCP server, RADIUS server) using:

[source,bash]
----
wget -O - https://inverse.ca/downloads/GPG_PUBLIC_KEY | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install packetfence
----

Getting Started
---------------

Now that PacketFence is installed, it needs to be configured. The PacketFence web-based configuration interface will automatically be started.

This section will guide you through configuring PacketFence as a simple RADIUS server. PacketFence will provide 802.1X support through Microsoft Active Directory and a Cisco 2960 access switch will be configured to integrate with PacketFence. The 802.1X client will be a Microsoft Windows 7 computer, connected of course on the wired network in the Cisco 2960 access switch. The following architecture diagram shows the interconnection of all components for our example:

image::getting-started.png["Getting Started",width="50%",scaledwidth="65%"]

NOTE: If you use another access switch, you must refer to PacketFence Network Devices Configuration Guide to adapt your configuration.

Going Through the Configurator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First open PacketFence's configurator - you can access it from https://@ip_of_packetfence:1443. If you are unsure what IP address you have, run `ip a` in your Linux shell. Perform the following actions:

 * Step 1 - Configure Network - make sure you define only one interface with the Management type. That network interface will be the one to which the Cisco 2960 access switch will talk to. The management interface of PacketFence and the Cisco 2960 should normally be in the same network. To set the interface to the Management type, click on the logical name to edit it
 * Step 2 - Configure PacketFence - provide the required information to properly create the PacketFence database and also provide your domain name, hostname and other required information. Make you sure to provide the PacketFence's admin username and password to be used
 * Step 3 - Fingerbank - provide your Fingerbank API key. Fingerbank is used to accurately identify Internet of Things (IoT) devices, medical devices, industrial and robotics equipment and more on your network. It is recommended to have a key for your PacketFence deployment. Without a Fingerbank API key, device profiling will not be available in PacketFence
 * Step 4 - Confirmation - save the passwords in a secure location and start PacketFence!

Once all services are started, you will automatically be redirected to the
PacketFence's web admin interface. It is located at
https://@ip_of_packetfence:1443/. Open that link and log in using the username/password specified in Step 2.

Connecting PacketFence to Microsoft Active Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we join the PacketFence server to your existing Microsoft Active Directory domain controller. From PacketFence's web admin interface, go in 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Domains->Active Directory Domain' and click on the 'Add domain' button. Provide the required fields. You will need an Active Directory administrative username and password (member of the domain admins) to join the PacketFence server to your domain. Once all the information has been provided, click on the 'Save and join button'.

Once the domain join succeeds, click on the 'REALMS' tab. Click on the 'Default' realm and set the domain to the Active Directory domain you have just created. That will instruct PacketFence to use that newly created Active Directory for the default authentication realm. Next, do the same thing for the NULL realm.

Next we add the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller as an authentication source in PacketFence. To do so, from 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Authentication Sources', click on 'Add source->Internal->AD'. Specify all the required fields. If you need help identifying fields relevant to your Active Directory environment, please use the Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) or AdsiEdit.mmc tools from your Active Directory server.

Next, add an 'Authentication Rules' with name 'catchall' with no condition and with the following actions:

 * Role - default
 * Access duration - 5 days

Make sure the information you provided are valid. Click on the 'Test' button to validate the provided information. If you see the message 'Success! LDAP connect, bind and search successful' - you have properly configured your Microsoft Active Directory authentication source. Save your new authentication source by clicking on the 'Save' button.

Configuring Cisco Catalyst 2960 Switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we configure a switch so that it integrates with PacketFence using 802.1X. In our example, we will use a Cisco Catalyst 2960 access switch and its IP address will be 172.21.2.3. Our PacketFence's server IP address will be 172.20.100.2 - you will need to adjust this according to your environment.

Connect to that switch over SSH as an admin.

Enable 802.1X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As a first configuration step, you need to enable 802.1X globally on the switch.  To do so, use the following:


   dot1x system-auth-control

Configure AAA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The next step is to configure AAA so it will use your newly created PacketFence server.  Make sure you replace the PF_MANAGEMENT_IP variable with your actual PacketFence management IP (172.20.100.2 in our example) in the following commands:

   aaa new-model
   aaa group server radius packetfence
    server PF_MANAGEMENT_IP auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813
   aaa authentication login default local
   aaa authentication dot1x default group packetfence
   aaa authorization network default group packetfence
   radius-server host PF_MANAGEMENT_IP auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 timeout 2 key useStrongerSecret
   radius-server vsa send authentication
   snmp-server community public RO
   snmp-server community private RW

Configure Switchport for 802.1X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once AAA is ready, we can configure some or all switchports to perform 802.1X. In our example, we will only configure port no. 10 to use 802.1X:

   interface fastEthernet 0/10
   switchport mode access
   authentication host-mode single-host
   authentication order dot1x mab
   authentication priority dot1x mab
   authentication port-control auto
   authentication periodic
   authentication timer restart 10800
   authentication timer reauthenticate 10800
   mab
   no snmp trap link-status
   dot1x pae authenticator
   dot1x timeout quiet-period 2
   dot1x timeout tx-period 3

Write the switch configuration to memory.

Adding the Switch to PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence must be aware of the equipment it manages. From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Network Devices->Switches', click on 'Add switch -> default'. Enter your switch IP address (172.21.2.3 in our example). As a switch type, select 'Cisco Catalyst 2960' and select 'Production' as the Mode. From the Roles tab, make sure 'Role by VLAN ID' is checked and that the VLAN ID associated to the default role is set to your normal VLAN currently in use on your network. In our example, it will be VLAN 20. That means that once a 802.1X authentication is allowed by PacketFence, access will be properly granted in the default role in VLAN 20.

From the RADIUS tab, specify the 'Secret Passphrase' to use - in our example, it is 'useStrongerSecret'. It is very important to correctly set the RADIUS secret passphrase otherwise PacketFence will prevent the switch from communicating to itself.

Finally, from the SNMP tab, provide the correct Community Read and Community Write values.

Configuring the Connection Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we need to configure the connection profile in PacketFence. That is required so that PacketFence knows how to handle a connection coming from the wired network or WiFi network. In our case, we will create a new connection profile to use our Microsoft Active Directory authentication source and also to let PacketFence know to automatically register any devices that successfully authenticate using 802.1X on the default connection profile.

From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles', click on on 'Add connection profile'. Specify the following information:

[options="compact"]
 * Profile Name: 8021x
 * Profile Description: 802.1X wired connections
 * Enable profile: checked
 * Automatically register devices: checked
 * Filters: If any of the following conditions are met:
   - Connection Type: Ethernet-EAP
 * Sources: your newly created Active Directory authentication source

Click on 'Save' to save all configuration changes.

Configuring Microsoft Windows Supplicant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable 802.1X on the wired adapter of the Microsoft Windows 7 endpoint, you first need to enable the 'Wired AutoConfig' service. To do so, from the Microsoft Windows Services control panel, double-click on 'Wired AutoConfig'. Make sure 'Startup type:' is set to 'Automatic' and click on 'Start' to enable the service.

Then, from Windows' Network Connection panel, open the Properties window of the LAN interface you will use for testing. From the authentication tab, make sure 'Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication' is checked. As the authentication method, make sure 'Microsoft: Protected EAP (PEAP)' is selected. Then, click on 'Settings' and make sure 'Validate server certificate' is unchecked. As authentication method, make sure 'Secured password (EAP-MSCHAPv2)' is selected. Then, click on 'Configure ...' and make sure 'Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any)' is unchecked.

Save all changes.

Testing
~~~~~~~

Now we are ready to do some testing. First make sure you restart the 'radiusd' service. That is required since we added a new Active Directory domain controller. From 'Status->Services', click on the 'Restart' button for the 'radiusd' service. PacketFence will take care of restarting that service and the 'radiusd-acct' and 'radiusd-auth' sub-services.

Connect the Microsoft Windows 7 endpoint on port no. 10 from the Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch. From Microsoft Windows, a popup should appear prompting you for a username and password. Enter a valid username and password from your Microsoft Active Directory domain - this should trigger 802.1X (EAP-PEAP) authentication.

To see what's going on from PacketFence, click on the 'Auditing' tab from PacketFence's admin interface. You should see an entry for the MAC address of your Microsoft Windows 7 endpoint. Click on the '(+)' button to see the RADIUS exchanges. If the 802.1X authentication is successful, you should have 'Accept' as an 'Auth Status'.

Alerting
~~~~~~~~

PacketFence can send emails to administrators, users and guests. So it is important to properly configure the mail sending functionality of PacketFence. From 'Configuration->System Configuration->Alerting', set at least the following fields:

[options="compact"]
 * Sender - the "From" address of emails being sent by PacketFence
 * SMTP server - IP or DNS name of the SMTP server used by PacketFence to send all emails

If your SMTP server requires authentication or encryption to relay emails, you will have to properly configure the SMTP encryption, username and password parameters.

Enabling the Captive Portal
---------------------------

In the previous section, we have succesfully configured 802.1X using PacketFence, Microsoft Active Directory and a Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch. While this demonstrates the fundamental role and capabilities of a NAC solution, most organizations are also looking at providing access to guests for example. One way of handling guests on a network is showing them a captive portal and let them register their own devices. This section will guide you in achieving this with PacketFence.

There are two ways PacketFence can show its captive portal for unknown (or unregistered) devices:

 * it can use Web Authentication (or also known as hotspot-style authentication) - this works with numerous equipment vendors
 * it can use a registration VLAN, where PacketFence provides DHCP services and DNS black-holing services - this works with any equipment vendors that support RADIUS dynamic VLAN assignment

For our example, we will use Web Authentication, as it is supported by the Cisco Catalyst 2960. For more information on various enforcement modes, please refer to the 'Supported Enforcement Modes' sections of this document.

Creating Authentication Source for Guests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep our example simple, we will simply create a captive portal for guests where they will only have to accept the terms and conditions prior to gaining network access. To do so, we must first create a 'Null' authentication source. From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Authentication Sources', click on 'Add Source->External->Null'. As 'Name' and 'Description', specify 'null-source'. Then add an 'Authentication Rules' with name 'catchall' with no condition and with the following tow 'Actions':

[options="compact"]
 * Role - guest
 * Access duration - 12 hours

Click on 'Save' to save the new authentication source.

Configure switchport for Web Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect to that switch over SSH as an admin.

First, we need to enable Change-of-Authorization (CoA) in our Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch configuration. We essentially need to allow our PacketFence server (172.20.100.2) to send CoA requests to the switch:

  aaa server radius dynamic-author
   client 172.20.100.2 server-key useStrongerSecret
   port 3799

Then, we must enable Web Authentication on switch port no. 10. Add the following configuration to the global section:

  ip device tracking
  ip http server
  ip http secure-server

Then add the required access list:

  ip access-list extended registration
   deny ip any host 172.20.100.2
   permit tcp any any eq www
   permit tcp any any eq 443


Adjust Switch Configuration in PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we have to let PacketFence know that Web Auth is to be used on the Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch. From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Switches' and click on your switch's IP to open its configuration options. From the 'Definition' tab, make sure 'Use CoA' and 'External Portal Enforcement' are checked and set the 'CoA Port' to 3799. From the 'Roles' tab, make the following changes:

[options="compact"]
 * in Role by VLAN ID, set the registration and guest VLAN ID to 20 - this will ensure unregistered clients are initially put in VLAN 20 and avoid a VLAN change once they properly authenticate from the captive portal
 * make sure 'Role by Switch Role' is checked and set the registration role to 'registration' - this will ensure the registration access list created in the previous section is returned for unregistered users. This will limit their access to the PacketFence captive portal
 * make sure 'Role by Web Auth URL' is checked and set the 'registration' URL to 'http://172.20.100.2/Cisco::Catalyst_2960'

Click 'Save' to save all configuration changes.

Enabling Portal on Management Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the PacketFence's captive portal does not listen on the management interface. To change this, go in 'Configuration->Network Configuration->Interfaces' and click on the logical name of your management interface to bring the configuration panel. In 'Additionnal listening daemon(s)' - make sure you add 'portal'.

You must then restart the following services from 'Status->Services':

[options="compact"]
 * haproxy-portal
 * httpd.portal
 * iptables

Configuring the Connection Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Web Authentication, we will create a new connection profile in PacketFence. That means the default connection profile will be used for 802.1X while the new connection profile will be used for Web Authentication and will be used to display a captive portal with our 'Null' authentication source. From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles' click on 'Add Profile'. Specify the following information:

[options="compact"]
 * Profile Name: guest
 * Filters: If any of the following conditions are met:
  * Connection Type: Ethernet-NoEAP
 * Sources: null-source

Click on 'Save' to save all configuration changes.

Testing
~~~~~~~

First make sure that the Microsoft Windows 7 endpoint is unplugged from the Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch. Then, make sure the endpoint is unregistered from PacketFence. To do this, from the 'Nodes' configuration module, locate its MAC address and click on it. From the node property window, change the 'Status' to 'unregistered.'

Next, we need to disable 802.1X from the network configuration card from the Microsoft Windows 7 endpoint. We want to simulate here an authentication by MAC address, so we have to disable 802.1X to do this. From Windows' Network Connection connection panel, ask for the properties of the LAN interface you will use for testing. From the authentication tab, make sure 'Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication' is unchecked. Save all changes.

Next, connect the endpoint in the Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch. After a few second, open a web browser and try to open any website - say http://packetfence.org. You should now see the captive portal. You should only need to accept the terms and conditions for gaining network access.

Authentication Sources
----------------------

PacketFence can authenticate users that register devices via the captive portal using various methods. Among the supported methods, there are:

[options="compact"]
* Active Directory
* Apache htpasswd file
* BlackHole
* Email
* External HTTP API
* Clickatell
* Facebook (OAuth 2)
* Github (OAuth 2)
* Google (OAuth 2)
* Instagram (OAuth 2)
* Kerberos
* Kickbox
* LDAP
* LinkedIn (OAuth 2)
* Null
* OpenID Connect (OAuth 2)
* Pinterest (OAuth 2)
* RADIUS
* SMS
* Sponsored Email
* Twilio
* Twitter (OAuth 2)
* Windows Live (OAuth 2)
* Password of the day

and many others. Moreover, PacketFence can also authenticate users defined in its own internal SQL database. Authentication sources can be created from PacketFence administrative GUI - from the 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources' section. Authentication sources, rules, conditions and actions are stored in the `conf/authentication.conf` configuration file.

Each authentication sources you define will have a set of rules, conditions and actions.

Multiple authentication sources can be defined, and will be tested in the order specified (note that they can be reordered from the GUI by dragging them around). Each source can have multiple rules, which will also be tested in the order specified. Rules can also be reordered, just like sources. Finally, conditions can be defined for a rule to match certain criteria. If the criteria match (one or more), actions are then applied and rules testing stop, across all sources as this is a "first match wins" operation.

When no condition is defined, the rule will be considered as a catch-all. When a catch-all is defined, all actions will be applied for any users that match in the authentication source. Once a source is defined, it can be used from 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles'. Each connection profile has a list of authentication sources to use.

In the previous section, you configured two authentication sources: Microsoft Active Directory and the Null sources. They were both catch-all sources.

Email Authentication for Guests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This section will show you how to allow guests to register endpoints using their email address. PacketFence sends a PIN code to the guest's email address. That code will then be required to complete the registration process.

Adding Email Authentication Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Authentication Sources', click 'Add source->External->Email'. As 'Name' and 'Description', specify 'email-source'.

Additional options available

 * email_activation_timeout - This is the delay given to a guest who registered by email confirmation to log into his email and click the activation link.
 * allow_localdomain - Accept self-registration from email address within the local domain
 * activation_domain - Set this value if you want to change the hostname in the validation link. Changing this requires to restart haproxy to be fully effective.
 * allowed_domains - A comma-separated list of domains that are allowed for email registration. Allowed domains are checked after banned domains.
 * banned_domains - A comma-separated list of domains that are banned for email registration. Banned domains are checked before allowed domains.

Then add an 'Authentication Rules' with name 'catchall' with no condition and with the following two 'Actions':

[options="compact"]
 * Role - guest
 * Access duration - 12 hours

Click on 'Save' to save the new authentication source.

Configuring the Connection Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's add our new Email-based authentication source to our guests captive portal. From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles', click on the 'guest' profile that we previously created. In the 'Sources', click on the '(+)' button and add the newly created Email source, 'email-source'. Save the changes by clicking on the 'Save' button.

NOTE: You can preview at any time the portal associated with connection profile by clicking on the 'Preview' button.

Testing
^^^^^^^

Unplug and unregister your endpoint. Reconnect the endpoint - you should see the captive portal with the new Email-based registration option.

Adding SMS Authentication for Guests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will show you how to enable SMS authentication on the captive portal so that guests use their cellular phone number to register their endpoints. PacketFence will send an SMS PIN code to the guest phone number. That code will be required to complete the registration process. The SMS code will be sent by PacketFence over email - using popular SMTP-to-SMS gateways.

Some of the key concepts presented in this section are:

[options="compact"]
 * Authentication sources

Adding SMS Authentication Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you understand what authentication sources and alerting are, we will add an SMS authentication source on our guest portal. We previously used the 'Null' source but we will add an other source. Portal profiles can provide multiple authentication sources.

From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Authentication Sources', click 'Add source->External->SMS'. As 'Name' and 'Description', specify 'sms-source'. Then add an 'Authentication Rules' with name 'catchall' with no condition and with the following two 'Actions':

[options="compact"]
 * Role - guest
 * Access duration - 12 hours

You will also need to select the proper carriers to do your test. Make sure you include the one your are using for your cellular phone.

Click on 'Save' to save the new authentication source.

[float]
Clickatell Source
+++++++++++++++++

To use Clickatell as an SMS source, first register at https://www.clickatell.com to get an API Key for the SMS integration. Then add it as an authentication source the same way as above, except choosing 'Clickatell' instead of 'SMS' in 'Add source->External'. Enter a name, description and your Clickatell API key in the source configuration, then add the authentication rule. 

Configuring the Connection Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's add our new SMS-based authentication source to our guests captive portal. From 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles', click on the 'guest' profile that we previously created. In the 'Sources', click on the '(+)' button and add the newly created SMS source, 'sms-source'. Save the changes by clicking on the 'Save' button.

NOTE: You can preview at any time the portal associated with connection profile by clicking on the 'Preview' button.

Testing
^^^^^^^

First unplug and unregister again the Microsoft Windows 7 endpoint. Then, connect the endpoint in switch port no. 10 - you should see the captive portal with the new SMS-based registration option. Note that the Null option will also be offered.

Introduction to Role-based Access Control
-----------------------------------------

One important key concept from NAC solutions is for seggretating network accesses. For example, an employee from the finance department might not have the same network access level as an other employee from the marketing department. Guests should also not have the same access level as normal employees within an organization. PacketFence uses roles internally to identify and differentiate users. For seggretating network access, PacketFence can use one or all of the following techniques:

[options="compact"]
 * ACL
 * VLAN or VLAN pool
 * equipment role

The techniques to use depends on the wired/WiFi equipment itself. A role in PacketFence will be eventually mapped to a VLAN, an ACL or an external role. You must define the roles to use in your organization for network access.

In our previous configuration examples, we made use of two roles that come by default in PacketFence: default and guest. We will now add two new roles - one for consultants and one used to authenticate machines on the network.

Adding Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Roles in PacketFence can be created from 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Roles'. From this interface, you can also limit the number of devices users belonging to certain roles can register.

Roles are dynamically computed by PacketFence, based on the rules (ie., a set of conditions and actions) from authentication sources, using a first-match wins algorithm. Roles are then matched to VLAN or VLAN pool or internal roles or ACL on equipment from the 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Switches' module. For a VLAN pool instead of defining a VLAN identifier, you can set a value like that: 20..23,27..30 - which means that the VLAN returned by PacketFence can be 20 to 23 and 27 to 30 (inclusively). There are three algorithms: one based on a hash of the username (default one), another one based on a round-robin (last registered device +1) and one that selects a VLAN randomly in the pool.

'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Roles', click on 'Add role'. Provide the following information:

[options="compact"]
 * Name: employee
 * Description: Role used for employees
 * Max nodes per user: 2

Redo the operation of the other role:

[options="compact"]
 * Name: corporate_machine
 * Description: Corporate owned machines
 * Max nodes per user: 1

Let's say we have two roles: employee and corporate_machine (defined above).

Now, we want to assign roles to employees and their corporate machines using Active Directory (over LDAP), both using PacketFence's captive portal.

Using the Employee Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources', we select 'Add source -> AD'. We provide the following information:

[options="compact"]
* *Name:* ad1
* *Description:* Active Directory for Employees
* *Host:* 192.168.1.2:389 without SSL/TLS
* *Base DN:* CN=Users,DC=acme,DC=local
* *Scope:* subtree
* *Username Attribute:* sAMAccountName
* *Bind DN:* CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=acme,DC=local
* *Password:* acme123

Then, we add an 'Authentication rules' by clicking on the 'Add rule' button and provide the following information:

[options="compact"]
* *Name:* employees
* *Description:* Rule for all employees
* Don't set any condition (as it's a catch-all rule)
* Set the following *actions:*
  - Set role employee
  - Set unregistration date January 1st, 2020

Test the connection and save everything. Using the newly defined source, any username that actually matches in the source (using the sAMAccountName) will have the employee role and an unregistration date set to January 1st, 2020.


Using the Corporate_Machine Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to differentiate user authentication and machine authentication using Active Directory, one way to do it is by creating a second authentication sources, for machines:

[options="compact"]
* *Name:* ad2
* *Description:* Active Directory for Corporate Machines 
* *Host:* 192.168.1.2:389 without SSL/TLS
* *Base DN:* CN=Computers,DC=acme,DC=local
* *Scope:* One-level
* *Username Attribute:* servicePrincipalName
* *Bind DN:* CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=acme,DC=local
* *Password:* acme123

Then, we add an 'Authentication rules':

[options="compact"]
* *Name:* machines
* *Description:* Rule for corporate machines
* Don't set any condition (as it's a catch-all rule)
* Set the following *actions:*
  - Set role corporate_machine
  - Set unregistration date January 1st, 2020

Using this configuration, employees can only connect corporate machines, not personal devices.

NOTE: When a rule is defined as a catch-all, it will always match if the username attribute matches the queried one. This applies for Active Directory, LDAP and Apache htpasswd file sources. Kerberos and RADIUS will act as true catch-all, and accept everything.

NOTE: If you want to use other LDAP attributes in your authentication source, add them in 'Configuration->System Configuration->Main Configuration->Advanced->Custom LDAP attributes'. They will then be available in the rules you define.

Supported Enforcement Modes
---------------------------

Prior configuring PacketFence, you must chose an appropriate enforcement mode to be used by PacketFence with your networking equipment. The enforcement mode is the technique used to enforce registration and any subsequent access of devices on your network. PacketFence supports the following enforcement modes:

[options="compact"]
* Inline
* Out-of-band using SNMP or RADIUS
* Hostpot-style (or Web Auth)
* RADIUS only
* DNS

It is also possible to combine enforcement modes. For example, you could use the out-of-band mode on your wired switches, while using the inline mode on your old WiFi access points.

The following sections will explain these enforcement modes. It will also explain you how to properly configure PacketFence to use each enforcement mode.

Technical Introduction to Inline Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In many other NAC solutions, it is not possible to support unmanageable devices such as entry-level consumer switches or access-points. Using PacketFence, with the new inline mode, it can be use in-band for those devices. So in other words, PacketFence would become the gateway of that inline network, and NAT or route the traffic using IPTables/IPSet to the Internet (or to another section of the network). Let see how it works.

Device Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No special configuration is needed on the unmanageable device. That's the beauty of it. You only need to ensure that the device is "talking" on the inline VLAN. At this point, all the traffic will be passing through PacketFence since it is the gateway for this VLAN.

Access Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The access control relies entirely on IPTables/IPSet. When a user is not registered, and connects in the inline VLAN, PacketFence will give him an IP address. At this point, the user will be marked as unregistered in the ipset session, and all the Web traffic will be redirected to the captive portal and other traffic blocked. The user will have to register through the captive portal as in VLAN enforcement. When he registers, PacketFence changes the device´s ipset session to allow the user's mac address to go through it.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

Inline enforcement because of it's nature has several limitations that one must be aware of.

[options="compact"]
* Everyone behind an inline interface is on the same Layer 2 LAN
* Every packet of authorized users goes through the PacketFence server increasing the server's load considerably: Plan ahead for capacity
* Every packet of authorized users goes through the PacketFence server: it is a single point of failure for Internet access
* Ipset can store up to 65536 entries, so it is not possible to have an inline network class greater than a class B

This is why it is considered a poor man's way of doing access control. We have avoided it for a long time because of the above mentioned limitations. That said, being able to perform both inline and VLAN enforcement on the same server at the same time is a real advantage: it allows admins to maintain maximum security while they deploy new and more capable network hardware providing a clean migration path to VLAN enforcement.

Technical Introduction to Out-of-band Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

VLAN assignment is currently performed using several different techniques. These techniques are compatible one to another but not on the same switch port. This means that you can use the more secure and modern techniques for your latest switches and another technique on the old switches that doesn't support latest techniques. As it's name implies, VLAN assignment means that PacketFence is the server that assigns the VLAN to a device. This VLAN can be one of your VLANs or it can be a special VLAN where PacketFence presents the captive portal for authentication or remediation.

VLAN assignment effectively isolate your hosts at the OSI Layer2 meaning that it is the trickiest method to bypass and is the one which adapts best to your environment since it glues into your current VLAN assignment methodology.

VLAN assignment techniques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wired: 802.1X + MAC Authentication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

802.1X provides port-based authentication, which involves communications between a supplicant, authenticator (known as NAS), and authentication server (known as AAA). The supplicant is often software on a client device, such as a laptop, the authenticator is a wired Ethernet switch or wireless access point, and the authentication server is generally a RADIUS server.

The supplicant (i.e., client device) is not allowed access through the authenticator to the network until the supplicant’s identity is authorized. With 802.1X port-based authentication, the supplicant provides credentials, such as user name / password or digital certificate, to the authenticator, and the authenticator forwards the credentials to the authentication server for verification. If the credentials are valid (in the authentication server database), the supplicant (client device) is allowed to access the network. The protocol for authentication is called Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) which have many variants. Both supplicant and authentication servers need to speak the same EAP protocol. Most popular EAP variant is PEAP-MsCHAPv2 (supported by Windows / Mac OSX / Linux for authentication against AD).

In this context, PacketFence runs the authentication server (a FreeRADIUS instance) and will return the appropriate VLAN to the switch. A module that integrates in FreeRADIUS does a remote call to the PacketFence server to obtain that information. More and more devices have 802.1X supplicant which makes this approach more and more popular.

MAC Authentication is a new mechanism introduced by some switch vendor to handle the cases where a 802.1X supplicant does not exist. Different vendors have different names for it. Cisco calls it MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), Juniper calls it MAC RADIUS, Extreme Networks calls it Netlogin, etc. After a timeout period, the switch will stop trying to perform 802.1X and will fallback to MAC Authentication. It has the advantage of using the same approach as 802.1X except that the MAC address is sent instead of the user name and there is no end-to-end EAP conversation (no strong authentication). Using MAC Authentication, devices like network printer or non-802.1X capable IP Phones can still gain access to the network and the right VLAN.

Wireless: 802.1X + MAC authentication
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wireless 802.1X works like wired 802.1X and MAC authentication is the same as wired MAC Authentication. Where things change is that the 802.1X is used to setup the security keys for encrypted communication (WPA2-Enterprise) while MAC authentication is only used to authorize (allow or disallow) a MAC on the wireless network.

On wireless networks, the usual PacketFence setup dictate that you configure two SSIDs: an open one and a secure one. The open one is used to help users configure the secure one properly and requires authentication over the captive portal (which runs in HTTPS).

The following diagram demonstrates the flow between a mobile endpoint, a WiFi access point, a WiFi controller and PacketFence:

image::radius-workflow.png["WiFi RADIUS workflow",width="75%",scaledwidth="100%"]

1. User initiates association to WLAN AP and transmits MAC address.  If user accesses network via a registered device in PacketFence, go to step 8.
2. The WLAN controller transmits MAC address via RADIUS to the PacketFence server to authenticate/authorize that MAC address on the AP.
3. PacketFence server conducts address audit in its database.  If it does not recognize the MAC address, go to step 4. If it does, go to step 8.
4. PacketFence server directs WLAN controller via RADIUS (RFC2868 attributes) to put the device in an "unauthenticated role“ (set of ACLs that would limit/redirect the user to the PacketFence captive portal for registration, or we can also use a registration VLAN in which PacketFence does DNS blackholing and is the DHCP server).
5. The user's device issues a DHCP/DNS request to PacketFence (which is a DHCP/DNS server on this VLAN or for this role) which sends the IP and DNS information.  At this point, ACLs are limiting/redirecting the user to the PacketFence's captive portal for authentication.  PacketFence fingerprints the device (user-agent attributes, DHCP information & MAC address patterns) to which it can take various actions including:  keep device on registration portal, direct to alternate captive portal, auto-register the device, auto-block the device, etc.    If the device remains on the registration portal the user registers by providing the information (username/password, cell phone number, etc.).  At this time PacketFence could also require the device to go through a posture assessment (using Nessus, OpenVAS, etc.).
6. If authentication is required (username/password) through a login form, those credentials are validated via the Directory server (or any other authentication sources - like LDAP, SQL, RADIUS, SMS, Facebook, Google+, etc.) which provides user attributes to PacketFence which creates user+device policy profile in its database.
7. PacketFence performs a Change of Authorization (RFC3576) on the controller and the user must be re-authenticated/reauthorized, so we go back to step 1.
8. PacketFence server directs WLAN controller via RADIUS to put the device in an "authenticated role“, or in the "normal" VLAN.


Web Authentication Mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Web authentication is a method on the switch that forwards HTTP traffic of the device to the captive portal.
With this mode, your device will never change of VLAN ID but only the ACL associated to your device will change.
Refer to the Network Devices Configuration Guide to see a sample web auth configuration on a Cisco WLC.

Port-security and SNMP
+++++++++++++++++++++

Relies on the port-security SNMP Traps. A fake static MAC address is assigned to all the ports this way any MAC address will generate a security violation and a trap will be sent to PacketFence. The system will authorize the MAC and set the port in the right VLAN. VoIP support is possible but tricky. It varies a lot depending on the switch vendor. Cisco is well supported but isolation of a PC behind an IP Phone leads to an interesting dilemma: either you shut the port (and the phone at the same time) or you change the data VLAN but the PC doesn't do DHCP (didn't detect link was down) so it cannot reach the captive portal.

Aside from the VoIP isolation dilemma, it is the technique that has proven to be reliable and that has the most switch vendor support.

More on SNMP traps VLAN isolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the VLAN isolation is working through SNMP traps all switch ports (on which VLAN isolation should be done) must be configured to send SNMP traps to the PacketFence host. On PacketFence, we use `snmptrapd` as the SNMP trap receiver. As it receives traps, it reformats and sends them into a redis queue, managed by `pfqueue` service. The multiprocessed `pfqueue` service reads these traps from the redis queue and takes a decision based on type of traps. For example, it can respond to them by setting the switch port to the correct VLAN. Currently, we support switches from Cisco, Edge-Core, HP, Intel, Linksys and Nortel (adding support for switches from another vendor implies extending the `pf::Switch` class). Depending on your switches capabilities, `pfqueue` will act on different types of SNMP traps.

image::diagram-trap-interaction.png[pfqueue SNMP interactions diagram, 400]

You need to create a registration VLAN (with a DHCP server, but no routing to other VLANs) in which PacketFence will put unregistered devices. If you want to isolate computers which have open security event in a separate VLAN, an isolation VLAN needs also to be created.

Link Changes (deprecated)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a host connects to a switch port, the switch sends a linkUp trap to PacketFence. Since it takes some time before the switch learns the MAC address of the newly connected device, PacketFence immediately puts the port in the Registration VLAN in which the device will send DHCP requests in order for the switch to learn its MAC address. Then `pfqueue` will send periodical SNMP queries to the switch until the switch learns the MAC of the device. When the MAC address is known, `pfqueue` checks its status (existing ? registered ? any security event?) in the database and puts the port in the appropriate VLAN. When a device is unplugged, the switch sends a 'linkDown' trap to PacketFence which puts the port into the Registration VLAN.

When a computer boots, the initialization of the NIC generates several link status changes. And every time the switch sends a linkUp and a linkDown trap to PacketFence. Since PacketFence has to act on each of these traps, this generates unfortunately some unnecessary load on `pfqueue`. In order to optimize the trap treatment, PacketFence stops every thread for a 'linkUp trap' when it receives a 'linkDown' trap on the same port. But using only linkUp/linkDown traps is not the most scalable option. For example in case of power failure, if hundreds of computers boot at the same time, PacketFence would receive a lot of traps almost instantly and this could result in network connection latency.

MAC Notification Traps (deprecated)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your switches support MAC notification traps (MAC learned, MAC removed), we suggest that you activate them in addition to the linkUp/linkDown traps. This way, `pfqueue` does not need, after a linkUp trap, to query the switch continuously until the MAC has finally been learned. When it receives a linkUp trap for a port on which MAC notification traps are also enabled, it only needs to put the port in the Registration VLAN and can then free the process. When the switch learns the MAC address of the device it sends a MAC learned trap (containing the MAC address) to PacketFence.

Port Security Traps
+++++++++++++++++++

In its most basic form, the Port Security feature remembers the MAC address connected to the switch port and allows only that MAC address to communicate on that port. If any other MAC address tries to communicate through the port, port security will not allow it and send a port-security trap.

If your switches support this feature, *we strongly recommend to use it rather than linkUp/linkDown and/or MAC notifications*. Why? Because as long as a MAC address is authorized on a port and is the only one connected, the switch will send no trap whether the device reboots, plugs in or unplugs. This drastically reduces the SNMP interactions between the switches and PacketFence.

When you enable port security traps you should not enable linkUp/linkDown nor MAC notification traps.


Technical Introduction to Hybrid Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions of PacketFence, it was not possible to have RADIUS enabled for inline enforcement mode. Now with the new hybrid mode, all the devices that supports 802.1X or MAC-authentication can work with this mode. Let's see how it works.

Device Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to configure inline enforcement mode in PacketFence and configure your switch(es) / access point(s) to use the VLAN assignment techniques (802.1X or MAC-authentication). You also need to take care of a specific parameter in the switch configuration window, "Trigger to enable inline mode". This parameter is working like a trigger and you have the possibility to define different sort of triggers:

  ALWAYS::
  PORT::
  MAC::
  SSID::

where ALWAYS means that the device is always in inline mode, PORT specify the ifIndex of the port which will use inline enforcement, MAC a mac address that will be put in inline enforcement technique rather than VLAN enforcement and SSID an ssid name.
An example:

  SSID::GuestAccess,MAC::00:11:22:33:44:55

This will trigger all the nodes that connects to the _GuestAccess_ SSID to use inline enforcement mode (PacketFence will return a void VLAN or the `inlineVlan` if defined in switch configuration) and the MAC address `00:11:22:33:44:55` client if it connects on another SSID.

Technical Introduction to RADIUS Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The concept of having a RADIUS enforcement is to not use registration, isolation, nor the portal capabilities of PacketFence. Everything here is for RADIUS integration only. By default the management interface will be the RADIUS interface. If needed, it is possible to add an other interface from 'Configuration->Network Configuration->Networks->Interfaces'. When doing so, you must select `Other` as the type of interface. Moreover, you must select `radius` as an additionnal listening daemon.

Using RADIUS enforcement, everytime a device connects to the network, a matching production VLAN will be assigned, depending on the rules in 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Authentication Sources'.

Technical Introduction to DNS Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

DNS enforcement allows you to control the network access of the device by using the `pfdns` service on PacketFence.

The architecture of DNS enforcement is as following :

* DHCP and DNS are provided by the PacketFence server
  - The PacketFence DHCP server will provide the IP of your network equipment as the gateway and the IP address of the PacketFence DNS server to resolve names.
* Routing is provided by another equipment on your network (core switch, firewall, router,...)
* `pfdns` will respond to DNS requests depending on your configuration :
  - user registration on portal : it will return IP address of the captive portal
  - access to another site : it will resolve name externally and use it in reply


This enforcement mode used by itself can be bypassed by the device by using a different DNS server or by using its own DNS cache.

The first can be prevented using an ACL on your routing equipment, the second can be prevented by combining DNS enforcement with Single-Sign-On on your network equipment. Please see the Firewall Single-Sign-On documentation for details on how to accomplish this.

In order to configure DNS enforcement, you first need to go in 'Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Interfaces' then select one of your interfaces and set it in DNS enforcement mode.

After, you need to configure a routed network for this interface by clicking 'Add routed network'. See the 'Routed Networks' section of this document for details on how to configure it.

NOTE: If you are not using a routed network, you need to use Inline enforcement as DNS enforcement can only be used for routed networks.

Once this is done, you need to restart the `pfdhcp` and `pfdns` services.

Troubleshooting PacketFence
---------------------------

RADIUS Audit Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence provides a RADIUS auditing module which allows you to be aware of all the incoming RADIUS requests/responses handled by PacketFence. The RADIUS auditing module is available from 'Auditing->RADIUS Audit Log'. Advanced search criterias can be specified to create complex search expressions - which can be saved for later use. Clicking on a RADIUS log entry will display the endpoint information, where the RADIUS request originated from and the RADIUS payload exchanged between the NAS and PacketFence.

Log files
~~~~~~~~~

Here are the most important PacketFence log files:

[options="compact"]
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/packetfence.log` — PacketFence Core Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.portal.access` — Apache – Captive Portal Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.portal.error` — Apache – Captive Portal Error Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.admin.access` — Apache – Web Admin/Services Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.admin.error` — Apache – Web Admin/Services Error Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.webservices.access` — Apache – Webservices Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.webservices.error` — Apache – Webservices Error Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.aaa.access` — Apache – AAA Access Log
* `/usr/local/pf/logs/httpd.aaa.error` — Apache – AAA Error Log

There are other log files in `/usr/local/pf/logs/` that could be relevant depending on what issue you are experiencing. Make sure you take a look at them.

The main logging configuration file is `/usr/local/pf/conf/log.conf`. It contains the configuration for the `packetfence.log` file (`Log::Log4Perl`) and you normally don't need to modify it. The logging configuration files for every service are located under `/usr/local/pf/conf/log.conf.d/`.

RADIUS Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, check the FreeRADIUS logs. The file is located at `/usr/local/pf/logs/radius.log`.

If this didn't help, run FreeRADIUS in debug mode. To do so, start it using the following commands.

For the authentication radius process:

[source,bash]
----
radiusd -X -d /usr/local/pf/raddb -n auth
----

For the accounting radius process:

[source,bash]
----
radiusd -X -d /usr/local/pf/raddb -n acct
----

Additionally there is a `raddebug` tool that can extract debug logs from a
running FreeRADIUS daemon. PacketFence's FreeRADIUS is pre-configured with such support.

In order to have an output from `raddebug`, you need to either:

a. Make sure user `pf` has a shell in `/etc/passwd`, add `/usr/sbin` to PATH (`export PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH`) and execute `raddebug` as `pf`
b. Run `raddebug` as root (less secure!)

Now you can run `raddebug` easily:

[source,bash]
----
raddebug -t 300 -f /usr/local/pf/var/run/radiusd.sock
----

The above will output FreeRADIUS' authentication debug logs for 5 minutes.

Use the following to debug radius accounting:

[source,bash]
----
raddebug -t 300 -f /usr/local/pf/var/run/radiusd-acct.sock
----

See `man raddebug` for all the options.


Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

This section details most of the authentication mechasnisms supported by PacketFence. It walks you through the required steps to properly use an authentication mechanism on your captive portal, for example. For Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) integration, please refer to the PKI Integration section from this document.

Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go in the Administration interface under 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> Active Directory Domains'.

NOTE: If you can't access this section and you have previously configured your server to bind to a domain externally to PacketFence, make sure you run `/usr/local/pf/addons/AD/migrate.pl`

Click *New Domain* and fill in the information about your domain.

image::domain-add.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Adding a new domain"]

Where :

* *Identifier* is a unique identifier for your domain. It's purpose is only visual.
* *Workgroup* is the workgroup of your domain in the old syntax (like NT4).
* *DNS name of the domain* is the FQDN of your domain. The one that suffixes your account names.
* *This server's name* is the name that the server's account will have in your Active Directory.
* *Sticky DC* is the preferred domain controller to connect to.
* *Active Directory server* is the IP or DNS name of one of the DC of the domain.
* *DNS server* is the IP address of the DNS server of this domain. Make sure that the server you put there has the proper DNS entries for this domain.
* *OU* is the OU in the Active Directory where you want to create your computer account.
* *ntlmv2 only* forces the NTLNM authentication (802.1X on AD) to use the NTLM version 2.
* *Allow on registration* would allow devices in the registration network to communicate with the DC.

NOTE: If you are using an Active/Active cluster, each member of the cluster must be joined separately. Please follow the instructions in the PacketFence Clustering Guide.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* In order to troubleshoot unsuccessful binds, please refer to the following file : `/chroots/<mydomain>/var/log/samba<mydomain>/log.winbindd`. Replace `<mydomain>` with the identifier you set in the domain configuration.

* You can validate the domain bind using the following command : `chroot /chroots/<mydomain> wbinfo -u`

* You can test the authentication process using the following command `chroot /chroots/<mydomain> ntlm_auth --username=administrator`

NOTE: Under certain conditions, the test join may show as unsuccessful in the Administration interface but the authentication process will still work properly. Try the test above before doing any additional troubleshooting. Also try reloading the page in the GUI since in some case the browser side of the ajax call may time out while the join actually succeeds.

Default Domain Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should now define the domain you want to use as the default one by creating the following realm in 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> REALMS'.

image::domain-default-realm.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Adding the default realm"]

Next, restart PacketFence in *Status -> Services*

Multiple Domains Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First configure your domains in 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> Active Directory Domains'.

Once they are configured, go in 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> REALMS'.

Create a new realm that matches the DNS name of your domain *AND* one that matches your workgroup. In the case of this example, it will be DOMAIN.NET tied to mydomain.

image::domain-add-realm.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Adding a new realm"]

Where :

* *Realm* is either the DNS name (FQDN) of your domain or the workgroup
* *Domain* is the Active Directory domain where PacketFence sends the NTLM request
* *Realm options* are any realm options that you want to add to the FreeRADIUS configuration
* *Domain* is the domain which is associated to this realm
* *RADIUS Auth* is the RADIUS authentication server to proxy the request to
* *Type* is the home server pool type
* *Authorize from PacketFence* specifies if we forward the request to PacketFence to have a dynamic answer or do we use the remote proxy server answered attributes
* *RADIUS Acct* is the RADIUS accounting server to proxy the request to
* *Type* is the home server pool type
* *Eduroam Realm Options* You can add Eduroam FreeRADIUS options in the realm definition
* *Eduroam RADIUS Auth* is the RADIUS Eduroam authentication server to proxy the request to
* *Type* is the home server pool type
* *Authorize from PacketFence* specifies if we forward the request to PacketFence to have a dynamic answer or do we use the remote proxy server answered attributes
* *Eduroam RADIUS Acct* is the RADIUS Eduroam accounting server to proxy the request to
* *Type* is the home server pool type
* *Strip on the portal* Should the usernames matching this realm be stripped when used on the captive portal
* *Strip on the admin* Should the usernames matching this realm be stripped when used on the administration interface
* *Strip in RADIUS authorization* Should the usernames matching this realm be stripped when used in the authorization phase of 802.1X
* *Custom attributes* Allow to use custom attributes to authenticate 802.1X users (attributes are defined in the source)
* *LDAP source* The LDAP Server to query the custom attributes

*Now associate DEFAULT and NULL realms to your domain.*

You should now have the following realm configuration

image::domain-realms-index.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Realms"]


OAuth2 Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: OAuth2 authentication does not work with Webauth enforcement

NOTE: OAuth2 authentication will fail by design when previewed through "Connection Profiles"

The captive portal of PacketFence allows a guest/user to register using his Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Windows Live, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, OpenID Connect or Github account.

For each providers, we maintain an allowed domain list to punch holes into the firewall so the user can hit the provider login page.
This list is available in each OAuth2 authentication source.

You must enable the passthrough option in your PacketFence configuration (fencing.passthrough in pf.conf).

Google
^^^^^^
In order to use Google as a OAuth2 provider, you need to get an API key to access their services.  Sign up here : http://code.google.com/apis/console.
In the Google APIs Console, go into 'Credentials -> Create Credentials -> OAuth client ID -> Web Application', then enter a name and make sure you use this URI for the "Authorized redirect URIs" field : https://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME/oauth2/callback.  Of course, replace the hostname with the values from `general.hostname` and `general.domain`.
Save to get the Client ID and Client secret.

You can keep the default configuration, modify the App ID & App Secret (Given by Google on the developer platform) and Portal URL (https://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME/oauth2/callback).

Also, add the following Authorized domains : *.google.com, *.google.ca, *.google.fr, *.gstatic.com,googleapis.com,accounts.youtube.com (Make sure that you have the google domain from your country like Canada => *.google.ca, France => *.google.fr, etc...)

Once you have your client id, and API key, you need to configure the OAuth2 provider. This can be done by adding a Google OAuth2 authentication source from 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources'.
Remember to add the Authentication Rules with at least two Actions (example: Role and Access duration).

Moreover, don't forget to add Google as a *Source* from your connection profile definition, available from 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles and Pages'.

Eduroam
~~~~~~~

[quote,Eduroam, https://www.eduroam.org/]
_____________________

Eduroam (education roaming) is the secure, world-wide roaming access service developed for the international research and education community.

Eduroam allows students, researchers and staff from participating institutions to obtain Internet connectivity across campus and when visiting other participating institutions by simply opening their laptop.
_____________________


PacketFence supports Eduroam and allows participating institutions to authenticate both locally visiting users from other institutions as well as allowing other institutions to authenticate local users.

Understanding of the Eduroam authentication workflow.

==== Local authentication

image::internal-eduroam-authentication.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Internal Eduroam authentication"]

. The device connects on the Eduroam SSID.
. The access point forwards the authentication request to the wireless controller.
. The controller sends the RADIUS authentication to PacketFence on port 11812.
. PacketFence checks if it's a local REALM.
. If it's local REALM, PacketFence does a NTLM request to the Active Directory (AD) domain controller to verify the identity.
[loweralpha]
.. The AD validated the credentials.
.. The AD did not validate the credentials. PacketFence sends a RADIUS Reject.
.. After a successful NTLM authentication, PacketFence returns a Radius Access Accept to the wireless controller to apply the production VLAN for that MAC address.
. If it's a not local REALM, PacketFence proxies the radius request to the Eduroam servers.
. The Eduroam servers validate the identity.
. PacketFence returns a Radius Access Accept to the wireless controller to apply the production VLAN for that MAC address.

==== Configure the Eduroam source

Open the PacketFence administration web interface and go to _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources_.

Local *Exclusive Sources* and click on `New exclusive source` then `Eduroam`.

The information to configure that source could be found on the Eduroam platform.

==== Create the connection profile for local authentication

Go to _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles -> New Connection Profile_.

Create a connection profile named `Local and external Eduroam authentication` Check `Automatically register devices` then create a SSID filter `Eduroam`. Make sure to add the Active Directory source to match on the local users.


==== Inbound authentication (TLRS to PF)

image::inbound-eduroam-authentication.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Inbound Eduroam authentication"]

. Eduroam sends the RADIUS authentication to a public IP address (NAT/PAT) bound to PacketFence on the management IP address (Management VIP for a cluster) on port 1812.
. PacketFence forwards the NTLM request to the Active Directory.
. NTLM response
[loweralpha]
.. Successful user identify authentication on the AD
.. NTLM request fails because of a bad identity
. PacketFence replies to the Eduroam servers either a RADIUS Access Accept for a sucessful authentication or a RADIUS access reject for an unsuccessful authentication. PacketFence sets the REALM to Eduroam for all successful authentications.

First, you need to refer to the previous step `Configure the Eduroam source`.

Once the source is configured, you will need to create a new connection profile.

==== Create the connection profile for outbound authentication

Go to _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles -> New Connection Profile_

Create the Connection Profile named `External Eduroam authentication` Check `Automatically register devices` then create a REALM filter `Eduroam`. Next, make sure to add the Eduroam source previouly created.

=== SAML Authentication

PacketFence supports SAML authentication in the captive portal in combination with another internal source to define the level of authorization of the user.

First, transfer the Identity Provider metadata on the PacketFence server. In this example, it will be under the path `/usr/local/pf/conf/idp-metadata.xml`.

Then, transfer the certificate and CA certificate of the Identity provider on
the server. In this example, they will be under the paths
`/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/idp.crt` and `/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/idp-ca.crt`. If
it is a self-signed certificate, then you will be able to use it as the CA in
the PacketFence configuration. Make sure `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and
`-----END CERTIFICATE----` headers are present in these certificate files.

Then, to configure SAML in PacketFence, go in `Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Sources` and then create a new Internal source of the type SAML and configure it.

image::saml-packetfence-config.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SAML PacketFence configuration"]

Where :

[options="compact"]
* *Service Provider entity ID* is the identifier of the Service Provider (PacketFence). Make sure this matches your Identity Provider configuration.
* *Path to Service Provider key* is the path to the key that will be used by PacketFence to sign its messages to the Identity Provider. A default one is provided under the path : `/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/server.key`
* *Path to Service Provider cert* is the path to the certificate associated to the key above. A self-signed one is provided under the path : `/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/server.key`
* *Path to Identity Provider metadata* is the path to the metadata file you transferred above (should be in `/usr/local/pf/conf/idp-metadata.xml`)
* *Path to Identity Provider cert* is the path to the certificate of the identity provider you transferred on the server above (should be in `/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/idp.crt`).
* *Path to Identity Provider CA cert* is the path to the CA certificate of the identity provider you transferred on the server above (should be in `/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/ca-idp.crt`). If the certificate above is self-signed, put the same path as above in this field.
* *Attribute of the username in the SAML response* is the attribute that contains the username in the SAML assertion returned by your Identity Provider. The default should fit at least SimpleSAMLphp.
* *Authorization source* is the source that will be used to match the username against the rules defined in it. This allows to set the role and access duration of the user. The 'Authentication' section of this document contains explanations on how to configure an LDAP source which can then be used here.

Once this is done, save the source and you will be able to download the Service Provider metadata for PacketFence using the link 'Download Service Provider metadata' on the page.

Configure your identity provider according to the generated metadata to complete the Trust between PacketFence and your Identity Provider.

In the case of SimpleSAMLPHP, the following configuration was used in `metadata/saml20-sp-remote.php` :


  $metadata['PF_ENTITY_ID'] = array(
    'AssertionConsumerService' => 'http://PORTAL_HOSTNAME/saml/assertion',
    'SingleLogoutService' => 'http://PORTAL_HOSTNAME/saml/logoff',
  );

NOTE: PacketFence does not support logoff on the SAML Identity Provider. You can still define the URL in the metadata but it will not be used.

==== Passthroughs

In order for your users to be able to access the Identity Provider login page, you will need to activate passthroughs and add the Identity Provider domain to the allowed passthroughs.

To do so, go in 'Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Fencing', then check 'Passthrough' and add the Identity Provider domain name to the 'Passhtroughs' list.

Next, restart `iptables` and `pfdns` to apply your new passthroughs.

Billing Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence integrates the ability to use a payment gateway to bill users to gain access to the network. When configured, the user who wants to access the network / Internet is prompted by a page asking for it's personal information as well as it's credit card information.

PacketFence currently supports four payment gateways: Authorize.net, Mirapay, Paypal and Stripe.

In order to activate the billing, you will need to configure the following components :

* Billing source(s)
* Billing tier(s)

Configuring a billing source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First select a billing provider and follow the instructions below.

Paypal
++++++

NOTE: This provider requires that your PacketFence server is accessible on the public domain. For this your PacketFence portal should be available on a public IP using the DNS server name configured in PacketFence.

If you have a business account and do not want to configure a test environment, you can skip the next section.

*Sandbox account*

To configure a sandbox paypal account for use in PacketFence, head to https://developer.paypal.com/ and either sign up or login into your existing account.

Then in the Sandbox menu, click 'Accounts'

Create an account that has the type 'Personal' and one that has the type 'Business'.

Afterwards, go back into accounts, and expand the business account, then click 'Profile'

image::billing/paypal-access-sandbox-profile.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Paypal access sandbox accounts"]

Now click the 'Change password' link and change the password and note it.

image::billing/paypal-change-password.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Paypal change sandbox password"]

Do the same thing with the personal account you created

*Configuring the merchant account*

Login into the Paypal business account that you created at https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/ if you are using a sandbox account or on https://www.paypal.com/ if you are using a real account.

Next go in 'My Account -> Profile' in order to go into your profile configuration.

Next in the 'Selling Preferences' you will need to select 'Website Payment Preferences'

Configure the settings so they match the screenshot below.

You should turn on 'Auto Return', set the return URL to https://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME/billing/paypal/verify.

You should also take note of the 'Identity Token' as it will be required in the PacketFence configuration.

image::billing/paypal-website-payment.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Paypal website payment settings"]

Next go back in your profile configuration 'My account -> Profile' and select 'Encrypted Payment Settings'

Now on this page you will need to submit the certificate used by PacketFence to Paypal (/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/server.crt by default).

Once you have submitted it, note it's associated 'Cert ID' as you will need to configure it in PacketFence.

Still on that page, click the 'Download' link to download the Paypal public certificate and put it on the PacketFence server under path : /usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/paypal.pem

image::billing/paypal-encrypted-payment.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Paypal encrypted payment settings"]

CAUTION: The certificate will *NOT* be the same if you use a sandbox account or a real account.

*Configuring PacketFence*

Now, in the PacketFence administration interface, go in 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Sources' and create a new source of type 'Billing -> Paypal'.

image::billing/paypal-packetfence-configuration.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Paypal PacketFence configuration"]

Where :
[options="compact"]
* *Identity token* is the one you noted when on the 'Website Payment Preferences' page.
* *Cert ID* is the one you noted when on the 'Encrypted Payment Settings'.
* *Payment type* is whether the access is donation based (not mandatory to pay for it).
* *Email address* is the email address of the merchant paypal account.
* *Cert file* is the path to the PacketFence certificate (/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/server.crt by default).
* *Key file* is the path to the PacketFence certificate (/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/server.key by default).
* *Paypal cert file* is the path to the Paypal certificate (/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/paypal.pem in this example).
* *Currency* is the currency that will be used in the transactions.
* *Test mode* should be activated if you are using a sandbox account.

NOTE: If they aren't already enabled, you will need to enable passthroughs so that users can reach the domains of this provider. Refer to the 'Passthroughs' section of this document for details

Stripe
++++++

*Stripe account*

First go on https://dashboard.stripe.com, create an account and login.

Next on the top right click 'Your account' then 'Account settings'.

Navigate to the 'API keys' tab and note your key and secret. The test key should be used when testing the configuration and the live key when putting the source in production.

image::billing/stripe-api-keys.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Stripe API keys"]

*Configuring PacketFence*

Now, in the PacketFence administration interface, go in 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Sources' and create a new source of type 'Billing -> Stripe'

image::billing/stripe-packetfence-configuration.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Stripe PacketFence configuration"]

Where :
[options="compact"]
* *Secret key* is the secret key you got from your Stripe account.
* *Publishable key* is the publishable key you got from your Stripe account.
* *Style* is whether you are doing a one-time charge or subscription based billing (recurring). See section 'Subscription based registration' below for details on how to configure it.
* *Currency* is the currency that will be used in the transactions.
* *Test mode* should be activated if you are using the test key and secret account.

NOTE: If they aren't already enabled, you will need to enable passthroughs so that users can reach the domains of this provider. Refer to the 'Passthroughs' section of this document for details

Authorize.net
+++++++++++++

*Creating an account*

First go on https://account.authorize.net to signup for a merchant account or http://developer.authorize.net/ for a sandbox account.

After you created your account you will be shown your 'API login ID' and 'Transaction key'. Note both of these information for usage in the PacketFence configuration.

Then login into your new account.

Then under 'Account' click 'Settings'.

On the settings page in the section 'Security settings', click 'MD5-Hash'

Now enter a secret that will be shared between authorize.net and PacketFence.

image::billing/authorize-md5-hash.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Stripe PacketFence configuration"]

*PacketFence configuration*

Next in the PacketFence administration interface, go in 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Sources' and create a new source of type 'Billing->AuthorizeNet'.

image::billing/authorize-packetfence-config.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Stripe PacketFence configuration"]

Where :
[options="compact"]
* *API login ID* is the one you got earlier while creating your account.
* *Transaction key* is the one you got earlier while creating your account.
* *MD5 hash* the one you configured in your Authorize.net account.
* *Currency* is the currency that will be used in the transactions.
* *Test mode* should be activated if you are using a sandbox account.

NOTE: If they aren't already enabled, you will need to enable passthroughs so that users can reach the domains of this provider. Refer to the 'Passthroughs' section of this document for details

Mirapay
+++++++

  To be contributed...

Adding billing tiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have configured one or more billing source, you need to define billing tiers which will define the price and target authentication rules for the user.

In the PacketFence administration interface, go in 'Configuration->Advanced Access Configuration->Billing tiers'

Then click 'Add billing tier' and configure it.

image::billing/billing-tier.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Stripe PacketFence configuration"]

Where :
[options="compact"]
* *Billing tier* is the unique identifier of the billing tier.
* *Name* is the friendly name of the billing tier.
* *Description* is an extended description of the billing tier.
* *Price* is the amount that will be charged to the user.
* *Access duration* is the amount of time the user will be granted access to your network.
* *Role* is the target role the user should be in.
* *Use time balance* defines if the access duration should be computed on real-time access duration meaning if the user buys 24 hours of access he can use the network for 24 hours in different time blocks. This requires a valid RADIUS accounting configuration.

NOTE: If don't want to use all the billing tiers that are defined, you can specify the ones that should be active in the 'Connection profile'.

Subscription based registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports subscription based billing using Stripe as a billing provider.

Billing tier
++++++++++++

When using subscription based billing, it is advised to configure the billing tier so it has an almost infinite access duration (e.g. 20 years) as the billing provider will be contacting the PacketFence server when the subscription is canceled.

You should configure a billing tier for each subscription plan you want to have. This example will use the plan 'simple' and 'advanced' configured using the following parameters.

  [simple]
  name=Simple network access
  description=Click here if you are poor
  price=3.99
  role=guest
  access_duration=10Y
  use_time_balance=disabled

  [advanced]
  name=Simple network access
  description=Click here if you are poor
  price=9.99
  role=advanced_guest
  access_duration=10Y
  use_time_balance=disabled

Stripe configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

Then in your Stripe dashboard, you should go in 'Subscriptions -> Plans'.

Then create a new plan.

image::billing/stripe-plan.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Stripe plan configuration"]

Where :
[options="compact"]
* *ID* is the billing tier identifier. It is *important* that this matches the ID of the billing tier in PacketFence.
* *Amount* is the price of the plan. It is *important* that this matches the price of the billing tier in PacketFence.
* *Currency* is the currency that will be used in the transactions. It is *important* that this matches the currency of the Stripe source in PacketFence.
* *Interval* is the interval at which the customer should be billed. In the case of this example, it is monthly.

Now, following the same procedure, create the advanced plan.

Receiving updates from Stripe
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As the subscription can be cancelled by a user, you need to setup your PacketFence installation to receive updates from Stripe.

Updates are sent using HTTP requests on a public IP.

You need to make sure that your PacketFence server is available through a public IP on port 80 and that your PacketFence server hostname resolves on the public domain.

Then, in Stripe, configure a 'Webhook' so Stripe informs PacketFence of any event that happens in this Stripe merchant account.

In order to do so go in 'Your Account -> Account Settings -> Webhooks' and click 'Add endpoint'.

image::billing/stripe-webhook.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Stripe Webhook"]

Where :
[options="compact"]
* *URL* is the URL to the PacketFence server. This should be http://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME/hook/billing/stripe
* *Mode* is whether this webhook is for testing mode or live mode

Now every time a user unsubscribes from a plan, PacketFence will be notified and will unregister that device from your network.

Extending access before it ends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence allows users to extend their access before it has ended. In order to do so, you need to enable 'Allow access to registration portal when registered' accessible via the 'Captive Portal' tab of the 'Connection Profiles'. Once this is activated, the users can reach https://YOUR_PORTAL_IP/status and select 'Extend your access' in order to be able to access the billing section after they have registered.

External API Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence also supports calling an external HTTP API as an authentication source. The external API needs to implement an authentication action and an authorization action.

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This should provide the information about whether or not the username/password combination is valid

These information are available through the POST fields of the request

The server should reply with two attributes in a JSON response

[options="compact"]
* *result* : should be 1 for success, 0 for failure
* *message* : should be the reason it succeeded or failed

Example JSON response :

  {"result":1,"message":"Valid username and password"}

Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This should provide the actions to apply on a user based on it's attributes

The following attributes are available for the reply : *access_duration*, *access_level*, *sponsor*, *unregdate*, *category*.

Sample JSON response, note that not all attributes are necessary, only send back what you need.

  {"access_duration":"1D","access_level":"ALL","sponsor":1
    ,"unregdate":"2030-01-01","category":"default"}

NOTE: See /usr/local/pf/addons/example_external_auth for an example implementation compatible with PacketFence.

PacketFence Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In PacketFence, you need to configure an HTTP source in order to use an external API.

Here is a brief description of the fields :

[options="compact"]
* *Host* : First, the protocol, then the IP address or hostname of the API and lastly the port to connect to the API.
* *API username and password* : If your API implements HTTP basic authentication (RFC 2617) you can add them in these fields. Leaving any of those two fields empty will make PacketFence do the requests without any authentication.
* *Authentication URL* : URL relative to the host to call when doing the authentication of a user. Note that it is automatically prefixed by a slash.
* *Authorization URL* : URL relative to the host to call when doing the authorization of a user. Note that it is automatically prefixed by a slash.

Advanced Portal Configuration
-----------------------------

Portal Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PacketFence captive portal flow is highly customizable. This section will cover the 'Portal Modules' which are used to define the behavior of the captive portal.

NOTE: When upgrading from a version that doesn't have the portal modules, the PacketFence Portal Modules configuration already comes with defaults that will fit most cases and offers the same behavior as previous versions of PacketFence. Meaning, all the available Connection Profile sources are used for authentication, then the available provisioners will be used.

First, a brief description of the available Portal Modules:

* Root: This is where it all starts, this module is a simple container that defines all the modules that need to be applied in a chained way to the user. Once the user has completed all modules contained in the Root, he is released on the network.
* Choice: This allows to give a choice between multiple modules to the user. The 'default_registration_policy' is a good example of a choice that is offered to the user.
* Chained: This allows you to define a list of modules that a user needs to go through in the order that they are defined - ex: you want your users to register via Google+ and pay for their access using PayPal.
* Message: This allows you to display a message to the user. An example is available below in _Displaying a message to the user after the registration_
* URL: This allows you to redirect the user to a local or external URL which can then come back to the portal to continue. An example is available below in _Calling an external website_.
* Authentication: The authentication modules can be of a lot of types. You would want to define one of these modules, in order to override the required fields, the source to use, the template or any other module attribute.
** Billing: Allows to define a module based on one or more billing sources
** Choice: Allows to define a module based on multiple sources and modules with advanced filtering options. See the section _Authentication Choice module_ below for a detailed explanation.
** Login: Allows you to define a username/password based module with multiple internal sources (Active Directory, LDAP, ...)
** SelectRole: Allows to define a module to override the role given when registering a device. For instance: an admin user is trying to register a device using the normal registration process, with this module the admin can choose which role to apply to the device while registering it. It will bypass authentication rules.
** Other modules: The other modules are all based on the source type they are assigned to, they allow to select the source, the AUP acceptance, and mandatory fields if applicable.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

This section will contain the following examples:

* Prompting for fields without authentication.
* Prompting additional fields during the authentication.
* Chained authentication.
* Mixing login and Secure SSID on-boarding on the portal.
* Displaying a message to the user after the registration.

Creating a custom root module
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, create a custom root module for our examples in order to not affect the default policy. In order to do so, go in 'Configuration ->  Advanced Access Configuration -> Portal Modules', then click 'Add Portal Module' and select the type 'Root'. Give it the identifier `my_first_root_module` and the description `My first root module`, then hit save.

Next, head to 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles', select the connection profile you use (most probably `default`) and then under 'Root Portal Module', assign `My first root module` then save your profile. If you were to access the captive portal now, an error would display since the Root module we configured doesn't contain anything.

You could add some of the pre-configured modules to the new Root module you created and that would make the error disappear.

Prompting for fields without authentication
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to prompt fields without authentication, you can use the Null source with the Null Portal Module.

PacketFence already comes with a Null source pre-configured. If you haven't modified it or deleted it, you can use it for this example. Otherwise, go in 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Sources' and create a new Null source with a catchall rule that assigns a role and access duration.

Then go in 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Portal Modules' and click 'Add Portal Module' and select 'Authentication -> Authentication::Null'. Set the 'Identifier' to `prompt_fields` and configure the module with the 'Mandatory fields' you want and uncheck 'Require AUP' so that the user doesn't have to accept the AUP before submitting these fields.

image::portal-modules/prompt_fields.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Prompt fields module"]

Next, add the `prompt_fields` module in `my_first_root_module` (removing any previous modules) and save it. Now when visiting the portal, it should prompt you for the fields you define in the module. Then, submitting these information will assign you the role and access duration that you defined in the `null` source.

Prompting additional fields during the authentication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to prompt additional fields during the authentication process for a module, you can define a Module based on that source that will specify the additional mandatory fields for this source.

You can also add additional mandatory fields to the default policies that are already configured.

This example will make the `default_guest_policy` require the user to enter a first name, last name and address so that guests have to enter these three information before registering.

Go in 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Portal Modules' and click the `default_guest_policy`. Add `firstname`, `lastname` and `address` to the 'Mandatory fields' and save.

Next, add the `default_guest_policy` to `my_first_root_module` (removing any previous modules). Now when visiting the portal, any of the guest sources configured in your connection profile will require you to enter both the mandatory fields of the source (ex: phone + mobile provider)  and the mandatory fields you defined in the `default_guest_policy`.

NOTE: Not all sources support additional mandatory fields (ex: OAuth sources like Google, Facebook, ...).

Chained authentication
++++++++++++++++++++++

The portal modules allow you to chain two or more modules together in order to make the user accomplish all of the actions in the module in the desired sequence.

This example will allow you to configure a 'Chained' module that will require the user to login via any configured OAuth source (Github, Google+, ...)  and then validate his phone number using SMS registration.

For the OAuth login we will use the `default_oauth_policy`, so just make sure you have an OAuth source configured correctly and available in your Connection Profile.

Then, we will create a module that will contain the definition of our SMS registration.

Go in 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Portal Modules' then click 'Add Portal Module' and select 'Authentication -> Authentication::SMS'.

Configure the portal module so that it uses the `sms` source and uncheck the 'Require AUP' option since the user will have already accepted the AUP when registering using OAuth.

image::portal-modules/sms.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SMS module"]

Then, add another Portal Module of type 'Chained'. Name it `chained_oauth_sms`, assign a relevant description and then add `default_oauth_policy` and `sms` to the 'Modules' fields

image::portal-modules/chained_oauth_sms.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Chained OAuth + SMS module"]

Next, add the `chained_oauth_sms` module in `my_first_root_module` (removing any previous modules) and save it. Now when visiting the portal, you should have to authentication using an OAuth source and then using SMS based registration.

Note that if you add want to keep some fields the user previously filled you can add 'Saved fields' in the portal module. Per example the first module ask for the telephone number and the second too, then you can add
'telephone' as a 'Saved fields' and the second module will not ask for it.

Mixing login and Secure SSID on-boarding on the portal
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example will guide you through configuring a portal flow that will allow for devices to access an open SSID using an LDAP username/password but also give the choice to configure the Secure SSID directly from the portal.

First, we need to configure the provisioners for the Secure SSID onboarding. Refer to section _Apple and Android Wireless Provisioning_ of this guide to configure your provisioners and add them to the connection profile.

Create a provisioner of the type `Deny` and add it with your other provisioners (putting any other provisioner before it). This will make sure that if there is no match on the other provisioners, it will not allow the device through.

Also in the connection profile add your LDAP source to the available sources so its the only one available.

Next, create a 'Provisioning' portal module by going in 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Portal Modules'. Set the 'Identifier' to `secure_boarding` and the description to `Board Secure SSID`. Also uncheck 'Skippable' so the user is forced to board the SSID should it choose this option.

Then, still in the Portal Modules, create a 'Choice' module. Set the 'Identifier' to `login_or_boarding` and description to 'Login or Boarding'. Add `secure_boarding` and `default_login_policy` to the 'Modules' field and save.

image::portal-modules/login_or_boarding.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Login or Boarding Secure SSID"]

Next, add the `login_or_boarding` module in `my_first_root_module` (removing any previous modules) and save it. Now when visiting the portal, you will have the choice between login to the LDAP source and gain access to the network or directly use provisioning in order to configure your device for a Secure SSID.

Displaying a message to the user after the registration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the 'Message' module you can display a custom message to the user. You can also customize the template to display in order to display a fully custom page.

Go in 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Portal Modules', then click 'Add Portal Module' and select 'Message'. Set the 'Identifier' to `hello_world` and the description to `Hello World`.

Then put the following in the 'Message' field

  Hello World !
  <a href="www.packetfence.org">Click here to access the PacketFence website!</a>

image::portal-modules/hello_world.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Hello World"]

Next, add `default_registration_policy` and `hello_world` in the 'Modules' of `my_first_root_module` (removing any previous modules) and save it. Now when visiting the portal, you should have to authenticate using the sources defined in your connection profile and you will then see the hello world message.

image::portal-modules/hello_world-my_first_root_module.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Hello World in my_first_root_module"]

Calling an external website
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the 'URL' module, you can redirect the user to a local or external URL
(as long as it is in the passthroughs). Then you can make it so the portal
accepts a callback in order for the flow to continue. Having a callback on
local or external URL is a requirement to use this portal module. Otherwise, users
will be *always* redirected to URL without any possibility to continue the
registration process.

In this example, the portal will redirect to an externally hosted PHP script that will give a random token to the user and then callback the portal to complete the registration process.

The example script is located in `addons/example_external_auth/token.php` and a README is available in that directory to set it up.

Once you have the script installed and working on URL: `http://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME:10000/token.php`, you can configure what you need on the PacketFence side.

Go in 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Portal Modules', then click 'Add Portal Module' and select 'URL'. Set the 'Identifier' to `token_system`, the 'Description' to `Token system` and the 'URL' to `http://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME:10000/token.php`.

image::portal-modules/token_system.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Token system"]

Next, add `default_registration_policy` and `token_system` in the 'Modules' of `my_first_root_module` (removing any previous modules) and save it. Now when visiting the portal, you should have to authenticate using the sources defined in your connection profile and then you will be redirected to example token system. Clicking the continue link on that system will bring you back to the portal and complete the registration process.

Authentication Choice module (advanced)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authentication Choice module allows to define a choice between multiple sources using advanced filtering rules, manual selection of the sources and selection of Portal Modules.

All the sources that are defined in the 'Sources' field will be available for usage by the user. Same goes for the modules defined in 'Modules'.

You can also define which mandatory fields you want to prompt for these authentication choices. Although you can still configure them on any 'Authentication Choice' module, they will only be shown if they are applicable to the source.

In addition to the manual selection above you can dynamically select sources part of the Connection Profile based on their object attribute (Object Class, Authentication type, Authentication Class).

NOTE: You can find all the authentication objects in `lib/pf/Authentication/Source`

* Sources by class: Allows you to specify the perl class name of the sources you want available
** ex: `pf::Authentication::Source::SMSSource` will select all the SMS sources. `pf::Authentication::Source::BillingSource` will select all the billing sources (Paypal, Stripe, ...)
* Sources by type: Allows you to filter out sources using the `type` attribute of the Authentication object
* Sources by Auth Class: Allows you to filter our sources using the `class` attribute of the Authentication object.

You can see the 'default_guest_policy' and 'default_oauth_policy' for examples of this module.

SelectRole
^^^^^^^^^^

The SelectRole module allows to define specific roles manually when registering a device. This is useful if for instance you ask your technical crew to register new devices.

The configuration is simple, you have a role which is the 'Admin role' the one allowed to select the role while registering a new device and the 'Role List' which is the list of roles that can be chosen from while registering a device.

For instance; techs are in the AD group tech support and get the role 'tech support' while registering, let's put 'tech support' as the 'Admin role'. They are allowed to register new devices with the roles 'default', 'voice' and 'guest'. Every time someone with the role 'tech support' will try to register a device on a connection profile where this portal module is active, then the crew memeber will be asked to choose which role to assign to this device.

Onfailure Onsuccess
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The on_failure and on_success actions allow you to create a more complex workflow and will permit to change the root portal module based on the result of the authentication.
Let's say you have a root portal module linked to a Authentication::Login module associated to a connection profile and you want to present a Guest authentication if the login failed.
Then you need to configure another root portal module "Guest" linked with a Authentication::SMS module and in the previous Authentication::Login add and action on_failure => Guest.

Portal Surveys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence has the ability to perform surveys via the captive portal and store the results in dedicated tables in the database.

Setup
^^^^^

In order for the survey tables to be created automatically based on the definition of your surveys, you must grant create and alter rights to the database user defined in pf.conf. By default this user is 'pf'. On your database, connect to the MariaDB CLI as root and execute the following:

  MariaDB> GRANT CREATE,ALTER ON pf.* TO 'pf'@'%';
  MariaDB> GRANT CREATE,ALTER ON pf.* TO 'pf'@'localhost';

Configuring your survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you will have to configure your survey in `/usr/local/pf/conf/survey.conf`. Here is an example of a survey:

[source,ini,numbered]
----
[survey1]
description=Mustard Turkey Sandwich Brothers

[survey1 field gender]
label=What is your gender?
type=Select
choices=<<EOT
M|Male
F|Female
EOT
required=yes

[survey1 field firstname]
label=What is your firstname?
type=Text
required=yes

[survey1 field lastname]
label=What is your lastname?
type=Text
required=yes

[survey1 field sandwich_quality]
label=On a scale of 1 to 5, how good was your sandwich today?
type=Scale
minimum=1
maximum=5
required=yes

[survey1 field prefered_sandwich]
label=What is your prefered sandwich?
type=Select
choices= <<EOT
Classic|Classic
Extra Turkey|Sandwich with extra turkey
Extra Mustard|Sandwich with extra mustard
EOT
required=yes

[survey1 field comments]
label=Enter any additionnal comments here
type=TextArea
required=no

[survey1 data ssid]
query=node.last_ssid

[survey1 data ip]
query=ip
----

NOTE: Make sure you reload the configuration after setting it up by doing `/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard`

In the example above, some of the data is being collected via fields on the captive portal directly (ex: `survey1 field firstname`) and some are collected via contextual data (ex: `survey1 data ssid`).

Fields are defined the following way:

 * *label*: The label/question that goes with the field which will be displayed on the portal
 * *table*: The table in which the survey data should be stored. If its not defined, it will use the ID of the survey. Tables are always prefixed with `survey_` even when this attribute is set.
 * *type*: The type of input that should be displayed to the user. The following types are available:
 ** *Select*: makes the user select a choice in a pre-defined list
 ** *Text*: a simple small text input
 ** *TextArea*: a bigger text input
 ** *Scale*: a numeric scale. The `minimum` and `maximum` attributes control the range of numbers the user can select
 ** *Checkbox*: a simple checkbox
 ** *Email*: a text field with email validation (only validates the format)
 * *required*: Whether or not the field is mandatory in the survey

Data fields are defined using a query and has access to node and person informations. Here are a few examples:

 * `node.last_ssid`: The SSID the device is connected to, if applicable
 * `node.device_class`: The Fingerbank device class
 * `node.last_switch`: The switch/controller/access point the device is connected to
 * You can get all the available node fields by executing the following command: `perl -I/usr/local/pf/lib -Mpf::node -MData::Dumper -e 'print Dumper(node_view("00:11:22:33:44:55"))'`
 * `person.source`: If there was authentication done in the portal, this will provide the source that was used
 * `person.email`: If there was authentication done in the portal, this will provide the email that was used
 * You can get all the available person fields by executing the following command: `perl -I/usr/local/pf/lib -Mpf::person -MData::Dumper -e 'print Dumper(person_view("admin"))'`
 * `ip`: The IP address of the client

Putting the survey on the portal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for your survey to be available on the portal, you will have to configure a portal module for it. In order to do so, go in 'Configuration->Advanced Access Configuration->Portal Modules' and create a new Survey portal module with the following settings:

image::survey-portal-module.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Survey portal module configuration"]

Then either add your survey to another portal module (Choice, Chained or Root) or create a Root portal module dedicated to the survey:

image::survey-root-portal-module.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Survey root portal module configuration"]

Once that is configured, make sure you have the right Root portal module on the applicable connection profile in 'Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles->Name of the profile->Root Portal Module'.

Exploring the collected data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the data that is collected in the example survey will be stored in a table
named `survey_survey1`. You can create 'Dynamic Reports' on your survey tables
via `/usr/local/pf/conf/report.conf`. Here is an example for the survey
created above:

[source,ini,numbered]
----
[survey1]
description=My first survey report
base_table=survey_survey1
columns=firstname as "Firstname", lastname as "Lastname", prefered_sandwich as "Prefered Sandwich", gender as "Gender"
----

NOTE: Make sure you reload the configuration after setting it up by doing `/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard`

Refer to the <<_dynamic_reports>> section of this document for advanced configuration.

Cleaning up
^^^^^^^^^^^

When you are happy with the structure of your surveys, it is recommended to remove the `CREATE` and `ALTER` rights to the `pf` database user from a security perspective. In order to do so, execute the following commands. This step is optional and should only be done once the structure of your survey is set in stone.

  MariaDB> REVOKE CREATE,ALTER ON pf.* FROM 'pf'@'%';
  MariaDB> REVOKE CREATE,ALTER ON pf.* FROM 'pf'@'localhost';


Devices Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users have the possibility to register their devices right from a special portal page. When accessing this page, users will be prompted to login as if they were registering themselves. Once logged in, the portal will ask them to enter the device MAC address that will then be matched against the Fingerbank database to match authorized devices list. The device will be registered with the user's id and can be assigned into a specific category for easier management.

In order to configure this, you can configure a self service portal policy in *Configuration->Advanced Access Configuration->Self Service Portal*. Either by modifying the default policy or creating a new one, you'll be able to define the behavior of the device registration page.
The portal page can be accessed by the following URL: https://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME/device-registration
This URL is accessible from within the network, in any VLAN that can reach the PacketFence server on a 'portal' interface (see note below). 

First, you can decide which role to assign to the devices registered through this self service portal. If left empty, the role of the user who is registering the device will be used.

You can also select which operating systems can be registered through this portal. This is useful for example, if you wish to only allow gaming devices to be registered through this portal.

Once you have configured your self service portal policy, you need to assign it to the appropriate connection profile in *Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles*.

After this, the page will be accessible at https://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME/device-registration.

WARNING: You may also have to add the 'portal' listening daemon on your management interface in order for this self service portal to be accessible to your users.

Status page
~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can have access to a self service portal that allows them to manage their devices. Using this portal, they can unregister devices they own and report them as stolen (triggering the *Lost or Stolen* violation).

Users of the local PacketFence database can also change their password through this portal.

By default all users can manage their devices through this self service portal. You can specify which roles can manage their devices on this page by configuring a self service portal policy in *Configuration->Advanced Access Configuration->Self Service Portal*. Then, make sure you assign this policy to the appropriate connection profile in *Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles*.

You can also prevent this page from being served in the PacketFence managed networks (registration, isolation, inline) by enabling the parameter *Status URI only on production network* in *Configuration->Advanced Access Configuration->Captive Portal*

After this, the page will be accessible at https://YOUR_PORTAL_HOSTNAME/status.

Once you have configured your self service portal policy, you need to assign it to the appropriate connection profile in *Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles*.

WARNING: You may also have to add the 'portal' listening daemon on your management interface in order for this self service portal to be accessible to your users.

Passthroughs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passthroughs are used to allow access to certain resources that are outside of the registration confinement process for the users that are in it.
A good example would be when you want to allow access to a password reset server even for clients that are currently on the captive portal.

There are two solutions for passthroughs - one using DNS resolution and iptables and the other one using Apache's mod_proxy module.
Note that non-HTTP (including HTTPS) protocols cannot use the mod_proxy approach.
You can use one of them or both but for if a domain is configured in both, DNS passthroughs have a higher priority.

In order to use the passthroughs feature in PacketFence, you need to enable it from the GUI in *Configuration->Network Configuration->Networks->Fencing*, enable *Passthrough* and then save.

DNS passthroughs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: In active-active cluster, `pfdns` needs to listen on VIP only. *Configuration->System Configuration->Cluster->pfdns on VIP only*

If you just enabled the passthroughs, you should restart the iptables services after configuring the parameter (`/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service iptables restart`).

Then add passthroughs in *Configuration->Network Configuration->Networks->Fencing->Passthroughs*. They can be of the following format:

 * *example.com*: opens ports 80 and 443 in TCP for example.com
 * *example.com:1812*: opens the port 1812 in TCP and UDP for example.com
 * *example.com:tcp:1812*: opens the port 1812 in TCP for example.com
 * *example.com:udp:1812*: opens the port 1812 in UDP for example.com

In addition to the options above, you can prefix the domain with `*.` (*.example.com) to white list all the subdomains of example.com (ex: `www.example.com`, `my.example.com`).

Should you combine multiple times the same domain with different ports (`example.com,example.com:udp:1812,example.com:udp:1813`) in the passthroughs, it will open all ports specified in all entries. In the previous example that would open ports 80, 443 in TCP as well as 1812 and 1813 in UDP.

Now when pfdns receives a request for one of these domains, it will reply with the real DNS records for the FQDN instead of a response that points to the captive portal.
At the same time, it will add the entry to a special ipset which will allow access to the real IP address attached the FQDN via iptables based routing.

Apache mod_proxy passthroughs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The proxy passthroughs can be configured in *Configuration->Network Configuration->Networks->Fencing->Proxy Passthroughs*.
Add a new FQDN (can also be a wildcard domain like *.google.com). Port specific passthroughs cannot be used as these only apply to port 80 in TCP.
Then for this FQDN, pfdns will still answer with the IP address of the captive portal and when a device hits the captive portal, PacketFence will detect that this FQDN has a passthrough configured in PacketFence and will forward the traffic to mod_proxy.

Proxy Interception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence enables you to intercept proxy requests and forward them to the captive portal. It only works one layer-2 networks  because PacketFence must be the default gateway.
In order to use the Proxy Interception feature, you need to enable it from the GUI in
*Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Fencing* and check *Proxy Interception*.

Add the port you want to intercept (like 8080 or 3128) and add a new entry in the `/etc/hosts` file to resolve the fully qualified domain name (fqdn) of the captive portal to the IP address of the registration interface. This modification is mandatory in order for Apache to receives the proxy requests.


Parked Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event that you are managing a large registration network with devices that stay there (ex: Students that can't register in your environment), these devices consume precious resources and generate useless load on the captive portal and registration DHCP server.

Using the parking feature, you can make these devices have a longer lease and hit an extremely lightweight captive portal so that the amount of resources they consume is minimal. In that captive portal, they will see a message explaining that they haven't registered their device for a certain amount of time, and will let them leave the *parked* state by pressing a link.

The *parked* vs *unparked* state is controlled through security event `1300003` which gets triggered according to the `parking.threshold` setting ('Configuration->Network Configuration->Networks->Device Parking').

So, in order to activate the parking, go in 'Configuration->Network Configuration->Networks->Device Parking' and set the threshold to a certain amount of seconds. A suggested value would be `21600` which is 6 hours. This means that if a device stays in your registration network for more than 6 hours in a row, it will trigger security event `1300003` and place that device into the *parked* state.

In that same section, you can define the lease length of the user when he is in the *parked* state.

NOTE: Parking is detected when a device asks for DHCP, if PacketFence is not your DHCP server for the registration network, this feature will not work. Also, if the device goes into the parked state with a lease time of 1 hour and the user immediately releases himself from the parking state, it will take 1 hour before the next detection takes place even if you set `parking.threshold` to a lower value.

Security Event 1300003
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This security event controls what happens when a user is detected doing parking.

Here are the main settings:

* You can add actions to the predefined ones (like 'Email admin' or 'External action') in 'Definition -> Actions'
* The amount of time a user can *unpark* their device is controlled through the 'Remediation -> Max enable' setting.
* The amount of grace time between two parking security events is controlled by the 'Remediation -> Grace' setting. This means, once a user release himself from the *parked* state, he will have at least this amount of time to register before the parking triggers again.
* The destination role (thus VLAN) of the user is controlled by 'Advanced -> Role'. You should leave the user in the registration role, but should you want to dedicate a role for parking, you can set it there.
* The `Template` attribute will only be used when the user is on the normal PacketFence portal and not the one dedicated for parking. If you want the user to access the non-parking portal, disable 'Show parking portal' in 'Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Device Parking'

== Advanced Access Configuration


=== Connection Profiles

PacketFence comes with a default connection profile. The follow parameters are important to configure no matter if you use the default connection profile or create a new one:

* Redirect URL under *Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profile -> Profile Name*

For some browsers, it is preferable to redirect the user to a specific URL instead of the URL the user originally intended to visit. For these browsers, the URL defined in `redirecturl` will be the one where the user will be redirected. Affected browsers are Firefox 3 and later.

* IP under *Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Captive portal*

This IP is used as the web server who hosts the `common/network-access-detection.gif` which is used to detect if network access was enabled. It cannot be a domain name since it is used in registration or quarantine where DNS is black-holed. It is recommended that you allow your users to reach your PacketFence server and put your LAN's PacketFence IP. By default we will make this reach PacketFence's website as an easier and more accessible solution.

In some cases, you may want to present a different captive portal (see below for the available customizations) according to the SSID, the VLAN, the switch IP/MAC or the URI the client connects to. To do so, PacketFence has the concept of connection profiles which gives you this possibility.

When configured, connection profiles will override default values for which it is configured. When no values are configured in the profile, PacketFence will take its default ones (according to the "default" connection profile).

Here are the different configuration parameters that can be set for each connection profiles. The only mandatory parameter is "filter", otherwise, PacketFence won't be able to correctly apply the connection profile. The parameters must be set in conf/profiles.conf:

.conf/profiles.conf
[source,ini,numbered]
----
[profilename1]
description = the description of your connection profile
filter = the name of the SSID for which you'd like to apply the profile, or the VLAN number
sources = comma-separated list of authentications sources (IDs) to use
----

Connection profiles should be managed from PacketFence's Web administrative GUI - from the 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles' section. Adding a connection profile from that interface will correctly copy templates over - which can then be modified as you wish.

* Filters under 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profile -> Profile Name -> Filters'

PacketFence offers the following filters: Connection Type, Network, Node Role, Port, realm, SSID, Switch, Switch Port, URI, VLAN and Time period.

Example with the most common ones:

* *SSID:* Guest-SSID
* *VLAN:* 100
* *Time period:* wd {Mon Tue} hr {1pm-3pm} -- See http://search.cpan.org/~pryan/Period-1.20/Period.pm
* *Switch Port:* <SwitchId>-<Port>
* *Network:* Network in CIDR format or an IP address

CAUTION: Node role will take effect only with a 802.1X connection or if you use VLAN filters.

* Advanced filter under 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profile -> Profile Name -> Advanced Filter'

In this section you are able to define an advanced filter in order to match specific attributes.

You have access to the following attributes:

.From the database (mean that it comes from a previous connection):
     autoreg
     status

PacketFence relies extensively on Apache for its captive portal, administrative interface and Web services. The PacketFence Apache configuration is located in `/usr/local/pf/conf/httpd.conf.d/`.

In this directory you have three important files: `httpd.admin`, `httpd.portal`, `httpd.webservices`, `httpd.aaa`.

* `httpd.admin` is used to manage PacketFence admin interface
* `httpd.portal` is used to manage PacketFence captive portal interface
* `httpd.webservices` is used to manage PacketFence webservices interface
* `httpd.aaa` is use to manage incoming RADIUS request

These files have been written using the Perl language and are completely dynamic - so they activate services only on the network interfaces provided for this purpose.

The other files in this directory are managed by PacketFence using templates, so it is easy to modify these files based on your configuration. SSL is enabled by default to secure access.

Upon PacketFence installation, self-signed certificates will be created in `/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl` (`server.key` and `server.crt`). Those certificates can be replaced anytime by your 3rd-party or existing wild card certificate without problems. Please note that the CN (Common Name) needs to be the same as the one defined in the PacketFence configuration file (`pf.conf`).

==== Reuse 802.1X credentials

Under certain circumstances, for example to show an AUP after a successful 802.1X connection, it might be interesting to have the ability to use an "SSO emulation" in the sense that the user does not need to re-enter his credentials on the portal after having entered them during the 802.1X EAP process. The 'Reuse 802.1X credentials' connection profile option will address this purpose. The same username as the one used during the 802.1X connection will be used against the different connection profile authentication sources to recompute the role from the portal.

As a security precaution, this option will only reuse 802.1X credentials if there is an authentication source matching the provided realm. This means, if users use 802.1X credentials with a domain part (username@domain, domain\username), the domain part needs to be configured as a realm under the RADIUS section and an authentication source needs to be configured for that realm. If users do not use 802.1X credentials with a domain part, only the NULL realm will be match IF an authentication source is configured for it.

=== VLAN Filter Definition

We added the ability to specify filters directly in the portion of code that
re-evaluates the VLAN or do a call to the API when we receive a RADIUS
request. These filters can be defined in _Configuration -> Advanced Access
Configuration -> Filter engines_.

These rules are available in different scopes:

  IsolationRole
  RegistrationRole
  RegisteredRole
  InlineRole
  AutoRegister
  NodeInfoForAutoReg

And can be defined using different criteria like:

  node_info.attribute (like node_info.status)
  switch
  ifIndex
  mac
  connection_type
  username
  ssid
  time
  owner.attribute (like owner.pid)
  radius_request.attribute (like radius_request.Calling-Station-Id)

There are some default VLAN filters defined in the configuration you can use to achieve the following goal:

EXAMPLE_Reject_between_11am_2pm::
  will revent a device from connecting when its role is "default", the SSID is "SECURE", the current time is between 11am and 2pm, from Monday to Friday and is a registered device

EXAMPLE_Trigger_event_if_user::
  will create a security event if the SSID is OPEN and the owner is igmout (the security event needs to have a custom trigger with the value 12345)

EXAMPLE_Autoregister_if_user::
  will autoregister the device and assign the role staff to each device where the username is igmout.

EXAMPLE_Autoregister_windows_devices::
  will autoregister all Windows devices and assign them the default role.

EXAMPLE_Reject_specific_MAC::
  will filter a MAC address and reject it by assigning the REJECT role.

EXAMPLE_Detect_VOIP::
  will automatically set Avaya and Polycom as phones by matching vendor MAC and set to default role

EXAMPLE_Reject_User_Unless_Machine::
  will refuse user authentication without prior machine authentication

EXAMPLE_Autoregister_Printer_Scanner::
  will autoregister printers and scanners and add a note.

You can have a look in the file [filename]`vlan_filters.conf`, there are some examples on how to use and define filters.

=== RADIUS Filter Definition

We added the ability to specify filters directly in the portion of code that return RADIUS attributes or do a call to the API.
These filters can be defined in _Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Filter engines_.

These rules are available in thoses scopes:

  returnRadiusAccessAccept is when you return the answer for a device access
  returnAuthorizeRead is when you return the answer for the switch read login access
  returnAuthorizeWrite is when you return the answer for the switch write login access
  returnAuthorizeVoip is when you return the answer for a VoIP device
  preProcess is when you want to manipulate the RADIUS context (like adding custom attributes to the request)

  packetfence.authorize call the RADIUS filter in the packetfence authorize section
  packetfence.authenticate call the RADIUS filter in the packetfence authenticate section
  packetfence.pre-proxy call the RADIUS filter in the packetfence pre-proxy section
  packetfence.post-proxy call the RADIUS filter in the packetfence post-proxy section
  packetfence-tunnel.authorize call the RADIUS filter in the packetfence-tunnel authorize section
  packetfence.preacct call the RADIUS filter in the packetfence preacct section
  packetfence.accounting call the RADIUS filter in the packetfence accounting section
  eduroam.authorize call the RADIUS filter in the eduroam accounting section
  eduroam.pre-proxy  call the RADIUS filter in the pre-proxy accounting section
  eduroam.post-proxy call the RADIUS filter in the post-proxy accounting section
  eduroam.preacct call the RADIUS filter in the eduroam preacct section

All the packetfence.* eduroam.* scopes are covered in the file radius_filters.conf, this is advanced configuration and you must know what you are doing.

And can be defined using different criteria like:

  node_info.attribute (like node_info.$attribute)
  switch
  ifIndex
  mac
  connection_type
  username
  ssid
  time
  owner.attribute (like owner.$attribute)
  radius_request.attribute (like radius_request.$attribute)
  security_event
  user_role
  vlan


There are some default RADIUS filters defined in the configuration you can use to achieve the following goal:

EXAMPLE_Ethernet-EAP-Accept::
  will return Access-Accept (with Cisco-AVPair attribute) when the connection is Ethernet-EAP and when there is no security event.

EXAMPLE_Session-timeout_Idle-Timeout_Terminate_action::
  will filter on the switch IP addresses and add the Session-Timeout (with a value between 10620 and 12600), the Idle-Timeout and Terminate-Action RADIUS attributes.

EXAMPLE_ipad_by_name::
  will use Fingerbank to target a specific devices (Apple iPad) and will add a Cisco ACLs to them.

EXAMPLE_eap-tls-preProcess::
  will create internal RADIUS attributes that will be used internally (like in the authentication rules).
  This rule will add the TLS-Stripped-UserName RADIUS attribute in the request
  and you will be able to use it in the authentication/administrations rules.

You can have a look in the file [filename]`radius_filters.conf`, there are some examples on how to use and define filters.

=== Advanced LDAP Authentication


==== ldapfilter action

ldapfilter action overrides the internal LDAP filter that PacketFence creates internally (uid=$username) so you can create a custom filter that matches your needs.

For example something like this (search for the user and check to see if it's permitted based on some criteria):

  (&(|(cn=${radius_request.Stripped-User-Name})(cn=${radius_request.User-Name}))(|(permitWifi=*)(grade=staff)(memberOf=CN=WifiGroup,OU=Security Groups,DC=ad,DC=acme,DC=com)))

==== Set_role_on_not_found action

set_role_on_not_found is a way to define a role if the rule doesn't match, let's take the ldapfilter example above.

If we add the action set_role_on_not_found = REJECT so it mean that the device will be rejected if the LDAP filter doesn't return anything. (if it matches then set_role action will be applied)

==== role_from_source action

role_from_source will check to see if the LDAP attribute exists and will add it in the ldap_attribute context (available in the radius filters)

So for example if you want to take the value of the LDAP attribute customRadius and add it in the RADIUS answer you need to do the following.

In the authentication rule, set an action "Role from source" to customRadius.
Next create a RADIUS filter that will add the custom RADIUS attributes:

  [IF_SET_ROLE_FROM_SOURCE]
  status=enabled
  answer.0=reply:Packetfence-Raw = $ldap_attribute.customRadius
  top_op=and
  description=If the role has been computed from the action set_role_from_source then return the value of the role as a RADIUS attribute
  scopes=returnRadiusAccessAccept
  radius_status=RLM_MODULE_OK
  merge_answer=no
  condition=action == "set_role_from_source"

Note, this supports multiples LDAP attributes, like customRadius:Airespace-Interface-Name=internet , customRadius:Aruba-User-Vlan=666

==== Append search attributes LDAP filter

This option will add as a & condition to the LDAP filter generated by PacketFence,
So for example the ldapfilter generated by PacketFence will be the following:

  (&(|(sAMAccountName=%{User-Name})(sAMAccountName=%{Stripped-User-Name})(cn=%{User-Name})(cn=%{Stripped-User-Name})(sAMAccountName=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}})))

and if you define a appended LDAP filter like:

  (|(memberOf=CN=Staff,OU=Security Groups,DC=ad,DC=acme,DC=com)(wifi=enabled))

Then the filter will be generated like that:

  (&(|(sAMAccountName=%{User-Name})(sAMAccountName=%{Stripped-User-Name})(cn=%{User-Name})(cn=%{Stripped-User-Name})(sAMAccountName=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}}))(|(memberOf=CN=Staff,OU=Security Groups,DC=ad,DC=acme,DC=com)(wifi=enabled)))

By doing that, event if you wont don't need the "Search Attributes" feature, you will be able to store the user's DN in the PacketFence-UserDN attribute.


==== basedn condition

This condition allow to override the default basedn in the LDAP source and it will permit to test if a object is in a specific ou.

=== Advanced Realm Configuration


In PacketFence you can define multiple realms to select on which domain you want to authenticate the users.

You can define a Realm with a regex in order to match multiple formats.

For example in the ACME realm we define the regex like this:

  .*\.acme\.com$

It means that if you have a user coming with this username mickey@la.acme.com , PacketFence will define the realm as la.acme.com (it will be included in the RADIUS request) and PacketFence will map the user to the ACME realm.

Advanced RADIUS Configuration
-----------------------------

This section presents the FreeRADIUS configuration steps. In some occasions, a RADIUS server is mandatory in order to give access to the network. For example, the usage of WPA2-Enterprise (Wireless 802.1X), MAC authentication and Wired 802.1X all require a RADIUS server to authenticate the users and the devices, and then to push the proper roles or VLAN attributes to the network equipment.

Local Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add your user's entries at the end of the `/usr/local/pf/raddb/users` file with the following format:

  username Cleartext-Password := "password"

Authentication against Active Directory (AD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform EAP-PEAP authentication using Microsoft Active Directory, please refer to the Active Directory documentation from the Authentication Mechanism section.

EAP Authentication against OpenLDAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate 802.1X connection against OpenLDAP you need to define the LDAP connection in `/usr/local/pf/raddb/modules/ldap` and
be sure that the user password is define as a NTHASH or as clear text.

[source,radius,numbered]
----
  ldap openldap {
    server = "ldap.acme.com"
    identity = "uid=admin,dc=acme,dc=com"
    password = "password"
    basedn = "dc=district,dc=acme,dc=com"
    filter = "(uid=%{mschap:User-Name})"
    ldap_connections_number = 5
    timeout = 4
    timelimit = 3
    net_timeout = 1
    tls {
    }
    dictionary_mapping = ${confdir}/ldap.attrmap
    edir_account_policy_check = no

    keepalive {
      # LDAP_OPT_X_KEEPALIVE_IDLE
      idle = 60

      # LDAP_OPT_X_KEEPALIVE_PROBES
      probes = 3

      # LDAP_OPT_X_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL
      interval = 3
    }
  }
----

Next in `/usr/local/pf/raddb/sites-available/packetfence-tunnel` add in the authorize section:

[source,radius,numbered]
----
authorize {
        suffix
        ntdomain
        eap {
                ok = return
        }
        files
        openldap
    }
----



EAP Guest Authentication on Email, Sponsor and SMS Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will allow local credentials created during guest registration to be used in 802.1X EAP-PEAP connections.

Caution: Be sure to select `plaintext` or `ntlm` as the "Database passwords hashing method" to make it work.

First create a guest SSID with the guest access you want to use (Email, Sponsor or SMS, ...) and activate 'Create local account' on that source.

At the end of the guest registration, PacketFence will send an email with the credentials for Email and Sponsor and SMS.

NOTE: This option doesn't currently work with the 'Reuse dot1x credentials' option of the captive portal.

In `/usr/local/pf/conf/radiusd/packetfence-tunnel` uncomment the line `# packetfence-local-auth` and restart radiusd.

This will activate the feature for any local account on the PacketFence server. You can restrict which accounts can be used by commenting the appropriate line in `/usr/local/pf/raddb/policy.d/packetfence`.
For example, if you would want to deactivate this feature for accounts created via SMS, you would have the following :

[source,radius,numbered]
----
packetfence-local-auth {
    # Disable ntlm_auth
    update control {
        &MS-CHAP-Use-NTLM-Auth := No
    }
    # Check password table for local user
    pflocal
    if (fail || notfound) {
        # Check password table with email and password for a sponsor registration
        pfguest
        if (fail || notfound) {
            # Check password table with email and password for a guest registration
            pfsponsor
            if (fail || notfound) {
                # *Don't* check activation table with phone number and PIN code
                # pfsms <--- This line was commented out
                if (fail || notfound) {
                    update control {
                       &MS-CHAP-Use-NTLM-Auth := Yes
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

NOTE: For this feature to work, the users' passwords must be stored in clear text in the database. This is configurable via `advanced.hash_passwords`.

EAP Local User Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal here is to use the local user to authenticate 802.1X device.

Edit `/usr/local/pf/conf/radiusd/packetfence-tunnel`

[source,radius,numbered]
----
# Uncomment the following line to enable local PEAP authentication
packetfence-local-auth
----

Restart the radiusd service in order to apply the change.

/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service radiusd restart

CAUTION: Take care of the "Database passwords hashing method" that has been configured in "Configuration -> System Configuration -> Main Configuration ->Advanced" or in the authentication source configuration (when you enabled "create local account") , the hash method must be `plaintext` or `ntlm` to be able to work.

Limit Brute Force EAP Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will allow you to limit a brute force attack and prevent the locking of Active Directory accounts.

Edit `/usr/local/pf/conf/radiusd/packetfence-tunnel`

[source,radius,numbered]
----
# Uncomment the following lines to enable this feature
packetfence-control-ntlm-failure
packetfence-cache-ntlm-hit
----

By default it will reject for 5 minutes a device that has been rejected twice in the last 5 minutes.
Fell free to change the default values in `raddb/policy.d/packetfence` and in `raddb/mods-enabled/cache_ntlm`

Testing
~~~~~~~

Test your setup with `radtest` using the following command and make sure you get an `Access-Accept` answer:

[source,radius,numbered]
----
# radtest dd9999 Abcd1234 localhost:18120 12 testing123
Sending Access-Request of id 74 to 127.0.0.1 port 18120
  User-Name = "dd9999"
  User-Password = "Abcd1234"
  NAS-IP-Address = 255.255.255.255
  NAS-Port = 12
rad_recv: Access-Accept packet from host 127.0.0.1:18120, id=74, length=20
----

RADIUS Accounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RADIUS Accounting is usually used by ISPs to bill clients.  In PacketFence, we are able to use this information to determine if the node is still connected, how much time it has been connected, and how much bandwidth the user consumed.

PacketFence uses RADIUS Accounting to display Online/Offline status in webadmin in 'Nodes' menu.


IP log updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you send the IP address of nodes in accounting data and want to update iplog entries of your nodes, you can enable 'Update the iplog using the accounting' setting from 'System configuration -> Main configuration -> Advanced'.


Security Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using PacketFence, it is possible to add security events to limit bandwidth abuse.  The format of the trigger is very simple:

   Accounting::[DIRECTION][LIMIT][INTERVAL(optional)]

Let's explain each chunk properly:

[options="compact"]
* `DIRECTION`: You can either set a limit to inbound(IN), outbound(OUT), or total(TOT) bandwidth
* `LIMIT`: You can set a number of bytes(B), kilobytes(KB), megabytes(MB), gigabytes(GB), or petabytes(PB)
* `INTERVAL`: This is actually the time window we will look for potential abuse.  You can set a number of days(D), weeks(W), months(M), or years(Y).

Example triggers
++++++++++++++++

* Look for Incoming (Download) traffic with a 50GB/month

   Accounting::IN50GB1M

* Look for Outgoing (Upload) traffic with a 500MB/day

   Accounting::OUT500MB1D

* Look for Total (Download + Upload) traffic with a 200GB limit in the last week

   Accounting::TOT200GB1W

Grace Period
++++++++++++

When using such security event feature, setting the grace period is really important.  You don't want to put it too low (ie. A user re-enable his network, and get caught after 1 bytes is transmitted!) or too high.  We recommend that you set the grace period to one interval window.


RADIUS Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~

RADIUS Proxy is a way to proxy authentication and accounting requests to other radius server(s) based on the realm.
Let's say you want to authenticate users on an Active Directory where there is a NPS server running and you don't want to join the PacketFence's server to this domain or in the case you want to integrate
PacketFence in a Passpoint setup then this section is for you.

To do that in PacketFence you need first to define the target RADIUS server(s) in Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources, and create the RADIUS source(s) (ACME1 ACME2).
In the Source configuration, fill the mandatory fields and add the options to define the home_server in FreeRADIUS. (https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v3.0.x/raddb/proxy.conf)

Per example for the RADIUS Source ACME1:

image::ACME1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="ACME RADIUS Source"]

$src_ip is a way to dynamically use the correct source ip address of the system in case of multiples network interfaces.

Next go in 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> REALMS', and add a new realm.

image::acme.com.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="ACME Realm Configuration"]

(type definition can be found here https://wiki.freeradius.org/features/Proxy)

Authorize from PacketFence will send the request to PacketFence to compute the role and access duration of the device.

In this case the easiest way to achieve that is to create a Authorization source (with rules), assign this source to a connection profile where you enabled "Automatically register devices" and where 
you defined a filter like Realm = acme.com .

Click on save and restart radius (pfcmd service radiusd restart).

Now when a device connect with the username bob@acme.com then the authentication and accounting requests will be forwarded to one of the ACME RADIUS servers.

RADIUS EAP Profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RADIUS EAP Profiles allow you to select a specific EAP profile in PacketFence based on the realm of the user.

In this EAP profile you can define:
 Certificates configuration.
 OCSP configuration
 EAP-Fast configuration
 TLS Configuration

And link all these configuration together.

For example the realm ACME.COM needs to use the CA certificate from ACME CA and the other realms need to use the default one.

To do that go in 'Configuration -> System Configuration -> RADIUS -> SSL Certificates' and create a new profile.
Next go in 'Configuration -> System Configuration -> RADIUS -> TLS Profiles' and create a new TLS profile and select the Certificate profile created just before.
Then create the EAP profile in 'Configuration -> System Configuration -> RADIUS -> EAP Profiles' and create a new EAP profile and select the TLS profile created before (PEAP Profile for exemple)

The last thing to do is to link the EAP profile with your realm configuration, to achieve that go in 'Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Domains -> Realms' and edit the ACME.COM realm (create it if it's not already the case) then choose the EAP profile you created before in the EAP configuration parameter.

Restart packetfence-radiusd-auth.service to generate the new RADIUS configuration. (systemctl restart packetfence-radiusd-auth.service)

Fingerbank Integration
----------------------

Fingerbank, a great device profiling tool developed alongside of PacketFence, now integrates with it to power-up the feature set allowing a PacketFence administrator to easily trigger security events based on different device types, device parents, DHCP fingerprints, DHCP vendor IDs, MAC vendors and browser user agents.

The core of that integration resides in the ability for a PacketFence system, to interact with the Fingerbank upstream project, which then allow a daily basis fingerprints database update, sharing unknown data so that more complex algorithms can process that new data to integrate it in the global database, querying the global upstream database in the case of an unknown match and much more.

Since the Fingerbank integration is now the "de facto" device profiling tool of PacketFence, it was a requirement to make it as simple as possible to configure and to use. From the moment a working PacketFence system is in place, Fingerbank is also ready to be used, but only in a "local" mode, which means, no interaction with the upstream Fingerbank project.

Onboarding
~~~~~~~~~~

To benefit from all the advantages of the Fingerbank project, the onboarding step is required to create an API key that will then allow interaction with the upstream project. That can easily be done only by going in the "Settings" menu item under the "Fingerbank" section of the PacketFence "Configuration" tab. From there, an easy process to create and save an user/organization specific API key can be followed. Once completed, the full feature set of Fingerbank can be used.

Update Fingerbank Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updating the Fingerbank data can't be easier. The only requirement is the onboarding process which allows you to interact with upstream project. Once done, an option to "Update Fingerbank DB" can be found on top of every menu item sections under "Fingerbank". Process may take a minute or two, depending on the size of the database and the Internet connectivity, after which a success or error message will be show accordingly. "Local" records are NOT being modified during this process.

Submit Unknown Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Saying that we don't know everything is not false modesty. In that sense, the "Submit Unknown/Unmatched Fingerprints" option is made available (after onboarding) so that unknown fingerprinting data going in and out on your network can easily be submitted to the upstream Fingerbank project for further analysis and integration the in the global database.

Upstream Interrogation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, PacketFence is configured to interrogate the upstream Fingerbank project (if onboarding has been completed) to fulfill a query with unmatched local results. Unmatched local results can result of an older version of the Fingerbank database or a requirement for a more complex algorithm due to the data set. That behavior is completely transparent and can be modified using the "Settings" menu item under the "Fingerbank"section of the PacketFence "Configuration" tab.

Local Entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible for an administrator who wants to customize an existing record (or create a new one) to do so using the "Local" entries. An upstream record (DHCP Fingerprint, DHCP Vendor, MAC Vendor, User Agent, Device type, even a Combination) can be cloned and then modified on a local basis if needed. Local records are always matched first since their purpose is to 'override' an existing one. A local combination can be created to match either "Local" or "Upstream" or both entries to allow identification of a device.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Fingerbank settings can easily be modified from the "Settings" menu item under the "Fingerbank" section of the PacketFence "Configuration" tab. There's documentation for each an every parameter that allow easier understanding.

Device change detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Fingerbank, you can perform detection of potential MAC spoofing by seeing if a device changes from a device class to another (ex: a device goes from Windows to a printer) and trigger a security event and potentially isolate the endpoint. An example security event using this trigger is available (security eventi ID 1300006, name "Fingerbank device class change").

This feature is disabled by default, in order to configure it, go in "Configuration -> Compliance -> Fingerbank Profiling -> Device Change Detection".

You should then check "Enabled" to activate this feature. You will then have the choice between triggering the security event on any device class change or on a specific set of changes.

Triggering on any device class change
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE: You should perform non-enforcing actions in the security event when initially deploying the feature to see if some corner cases may require whitelisting some device class transitions

The easiest method for performing this detection is to trigger on any device class change which will trigger the security event whenever the device is detected transitioning from any device class to another. Since some of these transitions may be normal in your environment, you can add whitelisting of transitions via the "Device class change whitelist" parameter which allows you to list valid transitions (ex: "Windows OS" to "Mac OS X or macOS").

Manual triggers
+++++++++++++++

Instead of detecting all transitions, you can perform detection and security event triggering on specific device class transitions. In order to do so, declare all the transitions that should trigger the security event in the "Manual device class change triggers".

Network Devices Anomaly Detection
---------------------------------

Starting with version 10, PacketFence integrates network devices anomaly detection capabilities. This means that PacketFence can detect abnormal network activies from devices - that is, if they are talking to a compromised host, if they are deviating from their pristine network profile and more. These capabilities come from the integration of the Fingerbank technology. That is, the Fingerbank Cloud API is responsible for producing pristine network device profiles while the Fingerbank Collector, included in PacketFence, does consume the pristine profiles and does anomaly detection based on its templating engine.

Creating Network Behavior Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A network behavior policy is a template, used by the Fingerbank Collector, to determine if the devices matching the criterias defined in the template ultimately deviate from a normal network usage pattern. You can create new templates from 'Configuration -> Compliance -> Network Anomaly Detection'.

Network behavior policies can be consumed from PacketFence's Security Events module.

Integration with Security Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After creating a network behavior policy, you can use it from the Security Events module of PacketFence. From 'Configuration -> Compliance -> Security Events', click on 'New Security Event.

You can use your policy by first adding a new trigger. The network behavior policy can be selected after defining an internal event on the following attributes:

* fingerbank_blacklisted_ips_threshold_too_high - Fingerbank Collector detected traffic to blacklisted IPs
* fingerbank_blacklisted_ports - Fingerbank Collector detected traffic to blacklisted ports
* fingerbank_diff_score_too_low - Fingerbank Collector detected a network behavior that doesn't match the known profile

Once done, the appropriate policy can be selected. If you want your entire network policy to be checked in the Security Events module, you must create three triggers - one with each of the attribute listed above together with your appropriate policy selected. You can look at the default security events Fingerbank profile anomaly (1300007) and Fingerbank detected blacklisted communication (1300008) for some examples on how to create customized security events to fulfill your requirements.

Intrusion Detection System Integration
--------------------------------------

Regex Syslog Parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are now able to create syslog parser using regex. This will allow you complex filters and rules to work on data receive via syslog.

Configuring a Regex Syslog Parser

- Enabled - You can enable/disable the parser from running
- Alert Pipe - A previously created alert pipe (FIFO)
- Rules - The list of rules that defines how to match log file entries and what action(s) to take when matching

Regex Syslog Parser Rule

- Name - The name of the rule
- Regex - The regex to match against a log entry. The regex may have https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[named captures] which can be used for parameter replacement start a '$'.
- Actions - A list of actions to take when the regex matches
- IP to MAC - Perform automatic translation of IPs to MACs and the other way around
- Last if matches - Stop processing the other rules if this rule matched

Defining Actions

An action have two parts

- method - The name of the action you want to take
- parameter list - The list of parameters you want to provide to the method. Each parameter is seperated by a comma. The parameters that are to be replaced by a named capture.

Example Action

Regex -

    mac\s*:\s*(?P&lt;mac&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9]{2}(:[a-zA-Z0-9]{2}){5}), notes\s*:\s*(P?&lt;notes&gt;.*)

Action -

    modify_node:  mac, $mac, notes, $notes

Suricata IDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence already contains a syslog parser for Suricata. This is an example to raise a security event from a syslog alert on the Suricata SID.

The first step is to create the syslog regex parser and then create the security event.

Syslog regex parser configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create the syslog regex parser you will need to go to 'Configuration -> Integration -> Syslog Parsers -> Add a Syslog Parser -> regex'

Here is the configuration of the syslog regex parser:

    Detector *: Suricata
    Enabled: checked
    Alert pipe: /usr/local/pf/var/suricata (To create the fifo file, do: mkfifo /usr/local/pf/var/suricata)

    Rules:

    Rule - New:

    Name *: ET P2P Kaaza Media desktop p2pnetworking.exe
    Regex *: (?P<date>\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4}-\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.*?)  \[\*\*\] \[\d+:(?P<sid>\d+):\d+\] (?P<message>.*?) \[\*\*\].* (?P<srcip>\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}):(?P<srcport>\d+) -> (?P<ip>\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}):(?P<port>\d+)
    Action: trigger_security_event mac, $mac, tid, $sid, type, detect
    Last if match: unchecked
    IP to MAC: checked

Save the regex rule.

You can directly test your rule. In the previous example the parser expect a syslog string like this:

    02/26/2017-14:29:00.524309  [**] [1:2000340:10] ET P2P Kaaza Media desktop p2pnetworking.exe Activity [**] [Classification: Potential Corporate Privacy Violation] [Priority: 1] {UDP} 173.194.7.75:443 -> 1.2.3.4:46742

In order to have a correct match in the rule, you will need to have a valid iplog entry in the database. Put the string in the test box and then click on the 'RUN TEST' button, you should get:

    Click to see actions for - 02/26/2017-14:29:00.524309 [**] [1:2000340:10] ET P2P Kaaza Media desktop p2pnetworking.exe Activity [**] [Classification: Potential Corporate Privacy Violation] [Priority: 1] {UDP} 173.194.7.75:443 -> 1.2.3.4:46742

    - ET P2P Kaaza Media desktop p2pnetworking.exe : trigger_security_event('mac', '00:11:22:33:44:55', 'tid', '2000340', 'type', 'detect')

We can see that PacketFence will execute the security event on the MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55.

Security Event Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you will need to create the security event with the trigger id '2000340' in order to isolate the device. In order to do so, go to *Configuration -> Compliance -> Security Events -> New Security Event*

Definition:

    Enabled: ON
    Identifier: 1500001
    Description: ET P2P Kaaza Media
    Action: Reevaluate Access Action; Log message
    Priority: 1

Triggers:

* Click on the + button
* Look for 'detect' in the dropdown list
* Add the trigger ID: 2000340 and click the ADD button
* Click on the '<' button next to 'Select Some Options'

Remediation:

    Auto Enable: checked
    Max Enables: 2
    Grace: 5 minutes
    Template: p2p.html

Click on the SAVE button.

Now you will need to restart the pfqueue and the pfdetect services.

    /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pfqueue restart

    /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pfdetect restart

Make sure that you have your pipe file otherwise the process won't start.

Security Onion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation and Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Security Onion is a Ubuntu-based security suite. The latest installation instructions are available directly from the Security Onion website, https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/Installation

Since a security suite consists of multiple pieces of software tied together, you may be prompted for different options during the installation process. A detailed "Production Deployment" guide can also be found directly from the Security Onion website: https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/ProductionDeployment

PacketFence Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once Security Onion is installed and minimally configured, integration with PacketFence is required to be able to raise security events based on sensor(s) alerts. syslog is used to forward sensor(s) alerts from Security Onion to the PacketFence detection mechanisms.

The simplest way is as follow (based on https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/ThirdPartyIntegration);

On the Security Onion server:

NOTE: Must be done on the master server running 'sguild'.

Configure `/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf` by adding the following to enable sending sguild log entries to PacketFence:

  ### PacketFence / IDS integration
  # This line specifies where the sguild.log file is located
  # -> Make sure to configure the right path along with the right filename (on a Security Onion setup, that should be pretty much standard)
  source s_sguil { file("/var/log/nsm/securityonion/sguild.log" program_override("securityonion_ids")); };
  # This line filters on the string “Archived Alert”
  filter f_sguil { match("Archived Alert"); };
  # This line tells syslog-ng to send the data read to the PacketFence management IP address using UDP 514
  # -> Make sure to configure the right PacketFence management interface IP address
  destination d_packetfence_alerts { udp("PACKETFENCE_MGMT_IP" port(514)); };
  # This line indicates syslog-ng to use the s_sguil source, apply the f_sguil filter and send it to the d_packetfence_alerts destination
  log { source(s_sguil); filter(f_sguil); destination(d_packetfence_alerts); };

NOTE: Ensure you change PACKETFENCE_MGMT_IP to the management IP address of your PacketFence server

Sending sguild alert output to syslog requires DEBUG to be changed from 1 to 2 under `/etc/sguild/sguild.conf`

  set DEBUG 2

A restart of the sguild daemon is then required

  sudo nsm_server_ps-restart

A restart of the syslog-ng daemon is then required

  service syslog-ng restart

On the PacketFence server:

Modify rsyslog configuration to allow incoming UDP packets by uncommenting the following two lines in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`:

  $ModLoad imudp
  $UDPServerRun 514

Configure `/etc/rsyslog.d/securityonion_ids.conf` so it contains the following which will redirect Security Onion sguild log entries and stop further processing of current matched message:

  if $programname == 'securityonion_ids' then /usr/local/pf/var/securityonion_ids
  & ~

Make sure the receiving alert pipe (FIFO) exists

  mkfifo /usr/local/pf/var/securityonion_ids

Restart the rsyslog daemon

  service rsyslog restart

At this point, Security Onion should be able to send detected alerts log entries to PacketFence.

A configuration of a new 'syslog parser' as well as some security events are the only remaining steps to make full usage of the Security Onion IDS integration.

Configuration of a new 'syslog parser' should use the followings:

  Type: security_onion
  Alert pipe: the previously created alert pipe (FIFO) which is, in this case, /usr/local/pf/var/securityonion_ids

Configuration of a new security event can use the following trigger types:

  Type: detect
  Triggers ID: The IDS triggered rule ID

  Type: suricata_event
  Trigger ID: The rule class of the triggered IDS alert

ERSPAN
~~~~~~

ERSPAN permits to mirror a local port traffic (low bandwidth) to a remote IP, E.G: your Security Onion already deployed box. ERSPAN encapsulates port traffic into ERSPAN then GRE and send that traffic to one/multiple destination(s). ERSPAN is a Cisco technology which is available only on some platforms, including: Catalyst 6500, 7600, Nexus, and ASR 1000.

One way of accessing encapsulated traffic at the destination host is through a software called RCDCAP, which is a daemon that creates a virtual interface if not existing, on which both GRE and ERSPAN headers are decapsulated prior to the traffic being injected to the previous interface. Security Onion can then feed on that interface like it would on any other, and if the RCDCAP daemon dies, continue to listen to that interface even though decapsulated traffic won't be available anymore.


Assumptions for the example:
The switch is at IP 172.16.0.1, the monitored switch port is GigabitEthernet0/10 and the Security Onion monitoring destination IP is 10.10.10.10 on eth2, eth2 ideally being a dedicated interface.

On Security Onion:

 * Enable Inverse repository for Security Onion:

StreamScan Comprimise Detection System (CDS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example to raise a security event from a syslog alert on a StreamScan alert ID.

The first step is to create the syslog regex parser and then create the security event.

Syslog regex parser configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create the syslog regex parser you will need to go to *Configuration -> Integration -> Syslog Parsers -> Add a Syslog Parser -> regex*

Here is the configuration of the syslog regex parser:

    Detector *: StreamScan
    Enabled: checked
    Alert pipe: /usr/local/pf/var/cds

    Rules:

    Rule - New:

    Name *: ET TROJAN
    Regex *:  CDS\[(?<cds_id>\d+)\].*?type=(?<type>[^ ]*).*?threat="(?<threat>.*?)" direction=(?<direction>[^ ]+) sourceip=(?<sourceip>\d+(\.\d+){3}) sourceport=(?<sourceport>\d+) destip=(?<ip>\d+(\.\d+){3}) destport=(?<destport>\d+) app=(?<app>[^ ]*) timestamp=(?<timestamp>[^ ]*) sid=(?<sid>\d+)
    Action: trigger_security_event mac, $mac, tid, $sid, type, detect
    Last if match: unchecked
    IP to MAC: checked

Save the regex rule.

You can directly test your rule. In the previous example the parser expect a syslog string like this:

    Apr 24 16:50:41 ubuntu CDS[13423]: type=alert threat="ET TROJAN Likely Zbot Generic Post to gate.php no accept headers" direction=outgoing sourceip=192.168.254.194 sourceport=53252 destip=5.175.143.42 destport=80 app=HTTP timestamp=2017-04-24_16-50-41.832096 sid=2022985

In order to have a correct match in the rule, you will need to have a valid iplog entry in the database. Put the string in the test box and then click on the 'RUN TEST' button, you should get:

    Results

    Click to see actions for - Apr 24 16:50:41 ubuntu CDS[13423]: type=alert threat="ET TROJAN Likely Zbot Generic Post to gate.php no accept headers" direction=outgoing sourceip=192.168.254.194 sourceport=53252 destip=5.175.143.42 destport=80 app=HTTP timestamp=2017-04-24_16-50-41.832096 sid=2022985
    - security event: trigger_security_event('mac', '00:11:22:33:44:55', 'tid', '2022985', 'type', 'detect')

We can see that PacketFence will execute the security event on the MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55.

Security Event Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you will need to create the security event with the trigger id '2000340' in order to isolate the device. In order to do so, go to *Configuration -> Compliance -> Security Events -> New Security Event*

Definition:

    Enabled: ON
    Identifier: 2022985
    Description: ET Trojan
    Action: Reevaluate Access Action; Log message
    Priority: 1

Triggers:

* Click on the + button
* Look for 'detect' in the dropdown list
* Add the trigger ID: 2022985 and click the ADD button
* Click on the '<' button next to 'Select Some Options'

Remediation:

    Auto Enable: checked
    Max Enables: 2
    Grace: 5 minutes
    Template: generic.html

Click on the SAVE button.

Now you will need to restart the pfqueue and the pfdetect services.

    /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pfqueue restart

    /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pfdetect restart

Make sure that you have your pipe file otherwise the process won't start.

Rsyslog Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to create a rsyslog configuration to forward all the syslog messages sent by StreamScan to the pipe file `/usr/local/pf/var/cds`

    mkfifo /usr/local/pf/var/cds

First you need to enable the syslog under the rsyslog configuration file located at /etc/rsyslog.conf, uncomment the two parameters:

    # Provides UDP syslog reception
    $ModLoad imudp
    $UDPServerRun 514

Then create the forwarding configuration:

    vim /etc/rsyslog.d/cds.conf

Put the follow configuration in it where the IP 1.2.3.4 is your syslog source server:

    if ($fromhost-ip=='172.20.20.181') then /usr/local/pf/var/cds
    &~

Restart rsyslog to apply the configuration

    service rsyslog restart


Firewall SSO Integration
------------------------

PacketFence is able to update some firewall based on device information, like the IP address, the username connected on it. Look below for integration guides to see how you can configure your firewall with PacketFence.
By default PacketFence uses the DHCP traffic to trigger an update on the firewall but it's also possible to do it with the RADIUS accounting traffic.

In order to manage the way you want to update the firewall, go in 'Configuration -> System Configuration -> Main Configuration -> Advanced',  then there are two choices:

* Trigger Single-Sign-On on accounting.
* Trigger Single-Sign-On on DHCP

You can use both methods at the same time but this will result in duplicate SSO requests if you receive the DHCP and accounting of the same device which can cause unexpected load on your firewall.

== Performing Compliance Checks

PacketFence supports either Nessus, OpenVAS and WMI as a scanning engine for compliance checks.
Since PacketFence v5.1 you are now able to create multiples scan engines configuration and assign them on specific captive portals.
It mean per example that you are now able to active a scan for specific Operating System only on a specific SSID.

=== Installation


==== Nessus


Please visit https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus to download Nessus v7 and install the Nessus package for your operating system. You will also need to register for the HomeFeed (or the ProfessionalFeed) in order to get the plugins.

After you installed Nessus, follow the Nessus documentation for the configuration of the Nessus Server, and to create a user for PacketFence.

NOTE: You may run into some issue while using Nessus with the Net::Nessus::XMLRPC module (which is the default behavior in PacketFence). Please refer to the http://packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1841[bug tracking system] for more information.

==== OpenVAS


===== Requirements


You will first need to install OpenVAS along with XYZ and ABC in order to manage OpenVAS remotely via the `omp` command line.

In order to validate proper connectivity from PacketFence to OpenVAS for remote management, execute the following command (replacing admin by the user you wish to use for PacketFence to communicate with OpenVAS):

  # omp -u admin -p 9390 -X "<get_version/>" 

The output of the above command should provide you the version of OpenVAS. Otherwise, ensure all the necessary components are in place for management through the `omp` command line client and that PacketFence is able to communicate with OpenVAS on port 9390.

===== Configuring the alert


You will need to configure an alert policy in OpenVAS to inform PacketFence of the completion of a task. The httpd.portal daemon takes care of handling this callback so you'll want to make sure that you have "portal" in your additionnal listening daemons on your management interface in PacketFence.

In order to create the alert policy, go in the Greenbone Security Assistant, then in "Configuration->Alerts" and create a new alert with the following configuration

image::openvas/alert.png[alt="OpenVAS alert"]

Where:

 * Name is of the value of your choosing
 * Ensure the event is set to "Task run status changed to: Done"
 * Ensure the condition is set to "Always"
 * Method is set to "HTTP Get"
 * HTTP Get URL is set to: http://PF_MANAGEMENT_IP/hook/openvas?task=$n
 ** In the URL above, only change PF_MANAGEMENT_IP to the management IP of your PacketFence server. Leave the rest of the URL untouched as this exact URL and format is expected by PacketFence.

===== Collecting the identifiers


Once you have connectivity working between PacketFence and OpenVAS, use the Greebone Security Assistant to obtain the following information for configuring PacketFence

*Alert ID*

Navigate to "Configuration->Alerts", then click on the alert you've configured above to view it, and note down the ID of the alert.

image::openvas/alert-id.png[alt="OpenVAS alert ID"]

*Scan config ID*

Navigate to "Configuration->Scan Configs" and then select the scan configuration you would like to use to scan the hosts. In this scan config view, note down the ID.

image::openvas/scan-config-id.png[alt="OpenVAS scan config ID"]

*Report format ID* 

Navigate to "Configuration->Report Formats" and then select the "CSV Results" report format. In this view, note down the ID.

image::openvas/report-format-id.png[alt="OpenVAS report format ID"]

==== WMI


You just have to enable WMI on each Microsoft Windows devices with a GPO from Active Directory.

=== Configuration


In order for the compliance checks to correctly work with PacketFence (communication and generate security events inside PacketFence), you need to configure these sections:

==== Scanner Definition

First go in Configuration and Scanner Definition: _Configuration -> Compliance -> Scan Engines_

Then add a scan engine

image::scan_type.png[alt="Scanner add"]

There are common parameters for each scan engines:

  Name: the name of your scan engine
  Roles: Only devices with these role(s) will be affected (Optional)
  OS: Only devices with this Operating System will be affected (Optional)
  Duration: Approximate duration of scan (Progress bar on the captive portal)
  Scan before registration: Trigger the scan when the device appear on the registration vlan
  Scan on registration: Trigger the scan just after registration on the captive portal
  Scan after registration: Trigger the scan on the production network (pfdhcplistener must receive production dhcp traffic)

Specific to Nessus:

  Hostname or IP Address: Hostname or IP Address where Nessus is running
  Username: Username to connect to Nessus scan
  Password: Password to connect to Nessus scan
  Port of the service: port to connect (default 8834)
  Nessus client policy: the name of the policy to use for the scan (Must be define on the Nessus server)

Specific to OpenVAS:

  Hostname or IP Address: Hostname or IP Address where OpenVAS is running
  Username: Username to connect to OpenVAS scan
  Password: Password to connect to OpenVAS scan
  Port of the service: port to connect (default 9390)
  Alert ID: the ID of the alert configuration on the OpenVAS server
  Scan config ID: the ID of the scanning configuration on the OpenVAS server
  Report format ID: the ID of the report format for the "CSV Results"

Specific to WMI:

  Username: A username from Active Directory that is allowed to connect to wmi
  Domain: Domain of the Active Directory
  Password: Password of the account
  WMI Rules: Ordered list of WMI rules you defined in Configuration -> Compliance -> Scans -> WMI Rules

==== WMI Rules Definition

If you have configured a WMI scan engine then you need to define WMI Rules.
WMI is a sort of database on each windows devices, to retrieve information on the device you need to know the SQL request.
In order to help you to find and make a rule you can use a third party tool like WMI Explorer.

Some example rules are defined in [filename]`/usr/local/pf/conf/wmi.conf.example` with
their description. You can browse these rules in _Configuration -> Compliance
-> WMI Rules_.

===== Rules syntax

The syntax of the rules are simple to understand and use same syntax as <<_vlan_filter_definition,VLAN filters>>.

* _Request_ is the SQL request you will launch on the remote device, you
  must know what the request will return to write the test.

Inside the _Rules Actions_ field we define 2 sorts of blocs:

* The test bloc (i.e. `[explorer]`)
* The action bloc (i.e. `[1:explorer]`)

The test bloc is a simple test based on the result of the request:

* attribute is the attribute you want to test
* operator can be:
** is
** is_not
** match
** match_not
** advance
* value is the value you want to compare

You can define multiple test blocs.

The action bloc is where you will define your logic. All actions available are
identical to <<_vlan_filter_definition,VLAN filters>>. Take a look at
[filename]`/usr/local/pf/conf/vlan_filters.conf.example` for all available actions.

==== WMI tab

It is possible to have the result of a WMI scan in the node section. To have
this, go into the rule configuration and check the box _On Node tab_. Now
configure your WMI scanner as you would usually do and you will be able to
have the results in the tab _WMI Rules_ under Node.

==== Security Events Definition

You need to create a new security event section and have to specify:

Using Nessus:

  trigger=Nessus::<security event ID>

Using OpenVAS:

  trigger=OpenVAS::<security event ID>

Where `security event ID` is either the ID of the Nessus plugin or the OID of
the OpenVAS plugin to check for. Once you have finished the configuration, you
need to reload the security event related database contents using:

[source,bash]
----
pfcmd reload security_events
----

NOTE: Security events will trigger if the plugin is higher than a low severity vulnerability.

==== Assign Scan definition to connection profiles

The last step is to assign one or more scanner you configured to one or more connection profiles.
Go in Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles -> Edit a Profile -> Add Scan

===== Hosting Nessus / OpenVAS remotely

Because of the CPU intensive nature of an automated vulnerability assessment, we recommend that it is hosted on a separate server for large environments. To do so, a couple of things are required:

[options="compact"]
* PacketFence needs to be able to communicate to the server on the port specified by the vulnerability engine used
* The scanning server need to be able to access the targets. In other words, registration VLAN access is required if scan on registration is enabled.

If you are using the OpenVAS scanning engine:

[options="compact"]
* The scanning server need to be able to reach PacketFence's Admin interface (on port 1443 by default) by its DNS entry. Otherwise PacketFence won't be notified of completed scans.
* You must have a valid SSL certificate on your PacketFence server

If you are using the Nessus scanning engine:

[options="compact"]
* You just have to change the host value by the Nessus server IP.

Rapid7 integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports integration with Rapid7 to start scans automatically when a device connects to the network and also to receive the Rapid7 alerts via syslog.

Rapid7 installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install the InsightVM application 
** https://insightvm.help.rapid7.com/docs/installing-in-linux-environments#section-installing-in-red-hat

* Run the application 
** https://insightvm.help.rapid7.com/docs/running-the-application#section-managing-the-application-in-linux

* Logon to the server: _https://'YourRapid7ServerIP:3780_

NOTE: Make sure that you create a site for the devices you want to manage in Rapid7, you will need to reference it in the PacketFence configuration

Configuring the scan engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rapid7 PacketFence user
+++++++++++++++++++++++

First, you will need to create credentials for PacketFence so that it can perform API calls on Rapid7. In order to do so, go in Administration and click on "Create" in the "Users" section in Rapid7. Then configure the appropriate username and password and make sure the account is enabled.

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

Next, in the roles of that user, select the "Custom" role and assign at least the following privileges to the new user:

[options="compact"]
* Manage Sites
* Manage Scan Engines
* View Site Asset Data
* Specify Scan Targets
* View Group Asset Data

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

Next, in "Site access" and "Asset group access", ensure you provide access to this user to all the assets and sites it needs to manage. When in doubt, grant access to all sites and asset groups.

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-3.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-4.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

Configure the scan engine in PacketFence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once you have the user created, you need to create the scan engine by going in Configuration -> Compliance -> Scan Engines and creating a new scan engine of the type "Rapid7"

Notes on the configuration:
[options="compact"]
* 172.20.20.230 is the IP address (hostname can also be configured) of your Rapid7 server
* Verify Hostname must be disabled unless you have a valid SSL certificate configured for the configured Rapid7 hostname
* Roles and OS represents the roles and operating systems for which you want to apply this scan engine. Leaving them empty will apply the policy to all devices.
* Scan before/on/after registration controls when the automated scans are started for the devices PacketFence sees. If you only want to start the scans manually, leave those unchecked.
* You will not be able to select a scan template, site and scan engine when initially configuring the engine. First configure the access and credentials and edit the engine again to be able to select those from the available values in Rapid7.

image::rapid7/rapid7-pf.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence config"]

Assign the engine to a connection profile
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the scan engine now created, you need to assign it to the connection profile that your endpoints use. In order to do so, go in Configuration -> Connection Profiles, select your connection profile and add your scan engine there.

image::rapid7/rapid7-connection-profile.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 connection profile"]

Viewing data on endpoints
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the scan engine integration completed, PacketFence will now automatically start scans on the endpoints it sees DHCP for and you will be able to view the Rapid7 information of the endpoints by going in the Nodes tab in PacketFence and then viewing a node and browsing its Rapid7 tab.

image::rapid7/rapid7-node-tab.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 node tab"]

Configuring the syslog integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence also supports integration with the syslog forwarding of Rapid7 (with or without the scan engine integration) in order to receive vulnerability alerts from Rapid7.

Sending syslog information to PacketFence
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Rapid7:
[options="compact"]
* First select the site you want to have alerts for and click on __Manage Site__
* In the site management tabs select *Alerts*, then create a new alert

[options="compact"]
*Enable*: Must be checked. 
*Alert Name*: Rsyslog to PacketFence or else.
*Maximum Alerts to send*: blank (none)
*Scan events*: Check all.
*Vulnerability Events*: _Any severity_ ; Check as well _Confirmed_, _Unconfirmed_, _Potential_
*Notification Method*: Select _Syslog message_
*Syslog Server*: PacketFence cluster VIP or server IP for a standalone

image::rapid7/rapid7-syslog.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 syslog"]

Creating the alert pipe on PacketFence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

WARNING: If you are using a PacketFence cluster, you will need to do these steps on all your PacketFence servers.

First, logon to PacketFence Server with a ssh terminal, then create the fifo pipe file that PacketFence will use to get data from Rapid7.

  mkfifo /usr/local/pf/var/run/nexpose_pipe

Create a new file named /etc/rsyslog.d/nexpose-log.conf with the following content

 # rsyslog conf for Rapid7 Nexpose server logs reception
 if $programname == 'Nexpose' then /usr/local/pf/var/run/nexpose_pipe
 & ~

Next, modify /etc/rsyslog.conf to accept syslogs data on 'udp 514' by uncommenting the following two lines:

 $ModLoad imudp
 $UDPServerRun 514

Restart the 'rsyslog' service

  service rsyslog restart

At this point PacketFence must be able to get the Rapid7 audit results via syslog.

TIP: You can see if the Nexpose server is sending to the right server by monitoring the traffic using `tcpdump -i any dst host YOUR_PACKETFENCE_SERVER_IP` on your Rapid7 Nexpose server and `tcpdump -i any src host YOUR_RAPID7_IP` on the PacketFence server.

Creating the syslog parser
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the Packetfence administration interface, go to *Configuration -> Integration -> Syslog parsers* and add a new Nexpose syslog parser

image::rapid7/rapid7-syslog-parser.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 syslog parser"]

[options="compact"]
* As Detector, put the name of your choice for this parser.
* In Alert pipe, put the 'absolute' path to our nexpose pipe (`/usr/local/pf/var/run/nexpose_pipe` if you used the same name as above)

Once done, restart the following services

  /usr/local/pf/pfcmd service pfdetect restart
  /usr/local/pf/pfcmd service pfqueue restart

Now that PacketFence is properly configured to receive information from Nexpose, we can configure it to perform some actions on the alerts it receives. In the PacketFence GUI, go to *Configuration -> Compliance -> Security Events* and create a new security event.

Make sure you set the following parameters in the 'Definition' tab:
[options="compact"]
* Enable: Set it to *ON* 
* Action: This is where you put what you want PacketFence to do, refer to the security events documentation in this guide for details on these.

Next, in the 'Triggers' tab:
[options="compact"]
* Click on the plus *(+)*, on the right side of the page.
* On the second line, choose the appropriate trigger between "*nexpose_event_contains*" or "*nexpose_event_start_with*"
* Choose "nexpose_event_contains" if you know, for example, the "*Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*" you want to take action on.
* For "*nexpose_event_contains*": You can put there the CVE or the vlnerability name you are looking for.
* For "*nexpose_event_start_with*": Put there the full vulnerability name you can find in the Nexpose report, on the Nexpose GUI
* Click on *ADD*, then *SAVE*

image::rapid7/rapid7-violation-trigger.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 security event trigger"]

[[provision]]
Integrating Provisioning Agents
-------------------------------

PacketFence Apple, Android and Windows Wireless Provisioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provisioners allow devices to automatically configure themselves to connect to the proper SSID (if applicable), use the proper authentication method (e.g. EAP-TLS) and trust the CA certificate and any certificate signed by it.

Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, iPods and Mac OS X (10.7+) support wireless profile importation using a special XML file format (mobileconfig). Android is also able to support this feature by importing the wireless profile with the Android PacketFence Agent. In fact, installing such file on your Apple device will automatically configure the wireless settings for a given SSID. This feature is often used when the SSID is hidden, and you want to ease the configuration steps on the mobile device (because it is often painful to configure manually). In PacketFence, we are going further, we generate the profile according to the administrator's preference and we pre-populate the file with the user's credentials (without the password). The user simply needs to install its generated file and he will be able to use the new SSID.

The Windows agent will import and apply the provisioned profile so that the user only needs to enter his username and password.

Configure the feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NOTE: If EAP-TLS provisioning is desired, you have to configure a PKI before going any further. Two sections exists to assist you: <<pf-pki,PacketFence PKI>>, which covers PacketFence's implementation, or <<ms-pki,PacketFence MSPKI>> which covers Microsoft's.

First of all, you need to configure the SSID that your devices will use after they go through the authentication process.

In the administration interface, go in 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Provisioners'. Then select 'android' / 'ios' / 'Windows' provisioner. Enter the SSID information and roles for which the provisioner applies. Repeat for all desired provisioners. Note that the default RADIUS certificate path is `/usr/local/pf/raddb/certs/server.crt`.

After, you simply need to add the 'Android', 'iOS' and 'Windows' provisioners to your 'Connection Profile' configuration. If no connection profile is defined, configure the 'default' connection profile to use the provisioners created.

NOTE: If you use two different connection profiles for the open and secure networks, make sure you configure the provisioners on both profiles.

To add a new provisioner for another class of devices to be supported, click on the 'Add Provisioner' button, and fill out the form, choosing a different Provisioning ID per provisioner.

* Roles: The "Roles" field defines which devices will be affected by the provisioning item. If empty, all devices for this class will be affected.
* SSID: The "SSID" field defines which SSID will be configured on the device using the authentication profile.
* EAP-Type: The EAP type defines the authentication method supported and should be set to EAP-TLS to integrate with the PacketFence PKI.
* Security type: The security type should be set to WPA2-Entreprise to integrate with the PacketFence PKI.
* PKI Provider: This should match the provider you configured in the PKI provider section.

We also advise you to configure a SSID for provisioning, for instance: `OnBoarding-PF`, open with MAC Authentication, pointing to PacketFence. Create a new Portal Profile, add a filter SSID with this SSID name, add the source you want the users to authenticate from and add your provisioners to this Portal Profile. From there, users who logged in will have to follow the captive portal instruction to get provided their certificate.

Android specifications
++++++++++++++++++++++

For Android provisioning support, you must activate and adjust the passthroughs. You might need to adapt them depending on your geolocality.

NOTE: Please refer to the 'Passthroughs' section of this guide if needed.

In the administation inferface, go in 'Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Fencing'. Activate 'Passthrough' and make sure the following passthroughs domains are present:

  *.ggpht.com,*.googleusercontent.com,android.clients.google.com,*.googleapis.com,*.android.clients.google.com,*.gvt1.com,*.l.google.com,play.google.com,*.gstatic.com

Then run the following commands so that passthroughs become effective:

 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard
 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service iptables restart
 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pfdns restart

iOS specifications
++++++++++++++++++

Mac OS X/iOS require the provisioning profile to be signed if you want to remove the `untrusted` warning when installing the profile. For more information, please refer to the PKI guides referred earlier in 'Configure the feature' above.

Other Corporate Devices
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's say that you now need to add some 'Linux computers' as 'corporate' devices.

Those devices cannot be authenticated via Machine Authentication, so we will need to use EAP-TLS and provide those devices with a certificate.

First of all make sure that your RADIUS certificate from the PacketFence server and the certificates that you will be provided are delivered from the same CA, else your authentication will not work. To enable EAP-TLS you will need to reconfigure the new RADIUS server certificate in the file conf/radiusd/eap.conf.

While creating the RADIUS server certifcate make sure to have the *Extended key usage: servAuth*.

Under the section `tls-config tls-common`, search for `private_key_file', `certificate_file' and `ca_file'. Those should contain respectively the path of:

 * the private key for your PacketFence server,
 * the server certificate issued by your CA for your PacketFence server,
 * the public key of your CA.

If you have an `OCSP` capable PKI you can configure it in the section `OCSP` in the eap.conf file.

Lastely you will need to restart RADIUS to ensure the use of the new configuration and certificates. Please do the following:

 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard
 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service radiusd restart

Make sure everything happens without errors.

Now that your RADIUS is ready to handle EAP-TLS, configure your SSID connection profile on the `corporate` device using this method. Generate a client certificate for your device and install it on.  

Please configure an EAPTLS source which can be found while adding a new sources under `Internal->`, simply give it a name, a description and a catch-all rule. This will allow you to validate the authentication via EAP-TLS.

You can now create a new Portal Profile for EAP-TLS. Under the tab configuration, section `Policies and Access Control->Connection Profiles`, `Add profile` and select as a filter the Sub Connection Type as EAP-TLS, add your source EAP-TLS. Check the box "Automatically register devices". 

You now have a full flow working for your corporate devices.

The following is an example on how to configure an EAP-TLS connection for Windows/Android/Mac OS X/iOS

image::scep-ms-pki-eaptls-example.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Provisioner EAP-TLS configuration"]

Mac OS X/iOS require the provisioning profile to be signed if you want to remove the `untrusted` warning when installing the profile. You need to sign it with a Certification Authority already trusted by the device such as e.g. VeriSign.
Configuring this has to be done in the 'Signing' tab in the "Apple devices". 

image::packetfence-pki-eaptls-sign-example.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Signing provisioner"]

Fill out the fields with the contents of the Base64 encoded certificates.
To extract this information from a pem formatted certificate, copy the file content included between the begin and end tag, not including the delimiters themselves.

Certificate file example:

----
----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE -----
1234567890asdfghjkl
zxcvbnmqwertyuiop78
----- END CERTIFICATE -----
----

Copy everything between the BEGIN and END lines, but not the lines themselves.
Repeat this operation for the certificate key and intermediate certificate.

----
----- BEGIN PRIVATE KEY -----
1234567890asdfghjkl
zxcvbnmqwertyuiop78
----- END PRIVATE KEY -----
----

Profile generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon registration, instead of showing the default release page, the user will be showing another version of the page saying that the wireless profile has been generated with a clickable link on it. To install the profile, Apple user owner simply need to click on that link, and follow the instructions on their device. Android user owner simply click to the link and will be forwarded to Google Play to install PacketFence agent. Simply launch the application and click to configure will create the secure SSID profile. It is that simple.

RHEL7 systemd early swapoff bug mitigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1031158[known bug] is still present in systemd-219-30.el7_3.7.x86_64 shipped with CentOS. (Debian fixed it in 228-3).

The bug arises because not all swap aliases are registered, which results in an incorrect dependence tree which results in swapoff being called way too early at shutdown.


Workaround
^^^^^^^^^^

 * Obtain the list of swap items that should be considered by systemd for it to enforce a correct ordering:

----
#grep swap /var/log/dmesg |grep "dead -> active"
----

In our example, that gave the following output:


 [    1.995413] systemd[1]: dev-dm\x2d1.swap changed dead -> active
 [    1.995495] systemd[1]: dev-cl-swap.swap changed dead -> active
 [    1.995550] systemd[1]: dev-disk-by\x2did-dm\x2dname\x2dcl\x2dswap.swap changed dead -> active
 [    1.995616] systemd[1]: dev-disk-by\x2did-dm\x2duuid\x2dLVM\x2dXOAK7DHxMdmQCrNdwWE3Pt836Q9pHYSGyrO9ycCGeIYavzbamVWNKMaVUMLf1NWZ.swap changed dead -> active
 [    1.995678] systemd[1]: dev-disk-by\x2duuid-6509e6e1\x2daf2d\x2d4d23\x2d9ebd\x2da9aa8801e658.swap changed dead -> active


 * Create /etc/systemd/system/swap.target and fill it with all swap aliases obtained from the previous command:


 [Unit]
 Description=Swap
 Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
 After=dev-disk-by\x2duuid-6509e6e1\x2daf2d\x2d4d23\x2d9ebd\x2da9aa8801e658.swap dev-dm1.swap dev-disk-by\x2did-dm\x2duuid\x2dLVM\x2dXOAK7DHxMdmQCrNdwWE3Pt836Q9pHYSGyrO9ycCGeIYavzbamVWNKMaVUMLf1NWZ.swap dev-disk-by\x2did-dm\x2dname\x2dcl\x2dswap.swap dev-cl-swap.swap dev-dm\x2d1.swap


IPTables
~~~~~~~~

IPTables is now entirely managed by PacketFence. However, if you need to perform some custom rules, you can modify `conf/iptables.conf` to your own needs. However, the default template should work for most users.

Log Rotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence can generate a lot of log entries in huge production environments. This is why we recommend to use `logrotate` to periodically rotate your logs. A working logrotate script is provided with the PacketFence package. This script is located under the `/usr/local/pf/packetfence.logrotate` file, and it's configured to do a daily log rotation and keeping old logs with compression. It has been added during PacketFence initial installation.

Large Registration Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the inline or VLAN enforcement mode in large environments, you may have ARP table overflows. This happens when a lot of devices are on the same layer 2 segment. The symptoms are dhcpd not handing out IP addresses as it should or failing pings in the registration or quarantine VLANs. To identify if you have this problem look into your `dmesg` log and if you see `Neighbour table overflow` messages.

In order to mitigate the problem, you need to tweak kernel settings.  In order to enlarge the ARP cache table on a live system, change the following in sysctl.conf :

---
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1 = 2048
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 4096
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 8192
---

Then run the following as root to enable the changes:

---
# sysctl -p
---

This means that the layer 2 garbage collection will kick in at 2048 MAC addresses exposed to the server with the most aggressive collection kicking in at 8192. This should be large enough for most but feel free to increase if necessary (at the cost of more kernel memory consumed). Another approach to solve this problem is to do more segmentation of your layer 2 networks.

Performance Optimizations
-------------------------

NTLM Authentication Caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This section assumes that you already have an Active Directory domain configuration both in 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Domains->Active Directory Domains' and 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Sources'. If you don't, you need to first configure those. Refer to the appropriate sections of this guide for details on how to configure those two components.

CAUTION: The cache requires minimally Windows Server 2008. Older versions will not work.

When using NTLM authentication against an Active Directory for 802.1X EAP-PEAP connections, this can become a bottleneck when handling dozens of authentications per seconds.

To overcome this limitation, it is possible to use a Redis driven cache inside PacketFence to reduce the amount of authentications requiring an external NTLM authentication call. Should a user be in the cache, PacketFence will attempt to compare the 802.1X credentials with those. In the even that the validation fails, a call to ntlm_auth is made. In the event of a cache miss, an ntlm_auth call is made as well. This ensures that even if a user changes his password, his new password is immediately valid for 802.1X EAP-PEAP connections even if the cache contains the outdated entry.

NOTE: The NTLM cache doesn't cache clear text passwords, it caches the NT hash of the user password.

PacketFence Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First of all, you will need to enable the NTLM caching globally by enabling 'NTLM Redis cache' in 'Configuration->System Configuration->Radius Configuration'. You then need to restart radiusd.

Once that is done, you need to configure PacketFence to start caching the credentials. In order to do so, go in 'Configuration->Policies and Access Control->Domains->Active Directory Domains' and select the domain you want to cache the credentials for.

Next, go in the 'NTLM cache' tab and:

 * Enable 'NTLM cache'
 * Select the Active Directory authentication source that is tied to this domain.
 * Adjust the 'LDAP filter' if necessary. Note that this is only used for the batch job.
 * Adjust the 'Expiration'
 * Enable 'NTLM cache background job' and/or 'NTLM cache on connection'. In the case of this example, both will be enabled.

image::domain-ntlm-cache.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Domain NTLM cache"]

Once done, click 'Save' to commit your changes.

After that, you will need to enable the `redis_ntlm_cache` service which is used by PacketFence to store the cached credentials. In order to do so, go in 'Configuration->System Configuration->Main Configuration->Services' and enable 'redis_ntlm_cache' and save the changes.

Next, start the service via pfcmd:

  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service redis_ntlm_cache start

If you chose to enable 'NTLM cache background job' in one of your domains, you will need to enable the pfmon job that will periodically cache the credentials. This can be configured in 'Configuration->System Configuration->Main Configuration->Maintenance->populate_ntlm_redis_cache'. It is advised to set the interval of this task to half the expiration of the credentials you have set in the domain configuration. This will ensure you have an optimal cache hit. Once done, restart the `pfmon` service.

Active Directory configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for PacketFence to be able to fetch the NTLM credentials from your Active Directory, it will need a user who has replication rights. The user to which you have to grant the rights, is the one that is configured in the authentication source that you associated in the 'NTLM cache' section of your domain.

Please refer to the following Microsoft KB entry to configure the replication rights (Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All): https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/303972

SNMP Traps Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence mainly rely on SNMP traps to communicate with equipment. Due to the fact that traps coming in from approved (configured) devices are all processed by the daemon, it is possible for someone who want to generate a certain load on the PacketFence server to force the generation of non-legitimate SNMP traps or a switch can randomly generate a high quantity of traps sent to PacketFence for an unknown reason.

Because of that, it is possible to limit the number of SNMP traps coming in from a single switch port and take action if that limit is reached. For example, if over 100 traps are received by PacketFence from the same switch port in a minute, the switch port will be shut and a notification email will be sent.

Here's the default config for the SNMP traps limit feature. As you can see, by default, PacketFence will log the abnormal activity after 100 traps from the same switch port in a minute. These configurations are in the `conf/pf.conf` file:

  [snmp_traps]
  trap_limit = enabled
  trap_limit_threshold = 100
  trap_limit_action =

Alternatively, you can configure these parameters from the PacketFence Web administrative GUI, in the *Configuration -> Network Configuration -> SNMP* section.

MariaDB optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuning MariaDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're PacketFence system is acting very slow, this could be due to your MariaDB configuration. You should do the following to tune performance:

Check the system load

  # uptime
  11:36:37 up 235 days,  1:21,  1 user, load average: 1.25, 1.05, 0.79

Check iostat and CPU

  # iostat 5
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    3.20   20.20   76.00
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0       32.40         0.00      1560.00          0       7800
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    2.20    9.20   88.00
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0        7.80         0.00        73.60          0        368
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    1.80   23.80   73.80
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0       31.40         0.00      1427.20          0       7136
  avg-cpu:  %user   %nice    %sys %iowait   %idle
             0.60    0.00    2.40   18.16   78.84
  Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
  cciss/c0d0       27.94         0.00      1173.65          0       5880

As you can see, the load-average is 1.25 and iowait is peaking at 20% - this is not good. If your iowait is low but your MariaDB is taking over %50 CPU this is also not good. Check your MariaDB install for the following variables:

  MariaDB> show variables;
  | innodb_additional_mem_pool_size | 1048576      |
  | innodb_autoextend_increment     | 8            |
  | innodb_buffer_pool_awe_mem_mb   | 0            |
  | innodb_buffer_pool_size         | 8388608      |

PacketFence relies heavily on InnoDB, so you should increase the `buffer_pool` size from the default values.

Go in the administration GUI , in Configuration -> System Configuration -> Database -> Advanced and raise the value of "InnoDB buffer pool size".

Then restart packetfence-mariadb

  # systemctl restart packetfence-mariadb

Wait 10 minutes re-check iostat and CPU

MariaDB Optimization Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend that you run the http://mysqltuner.com/[MySQL Tuner] on your database setup after a couple of weeks to help you identify MariaDB configuration improvement. The tool is bundled with PacketFence and can be run from the command-line:

  # /usr/local/pf/bin/pftest mysql

Avoid "Too many connections" problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a wireless context, there tends to be a lot of connections made to the database by our `freeradius` module. The default MariaDB value tend to be low (100) so we encourage you to increase that value to at least 300. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/too-many-connections.html for details.

Avoid "Host <hostname> is blocked" problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a wireless context, there tend to be a lot of connections made to the database by our freeradius module. When the server is loaded, these connection attempts can timeout. If a connection times out during connection, MariaDB will consider this a connection error and after 10 of these (by default) he will lock the host out with a:

  Host 'host_name' is blocked because of many connection errors. Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'

This will grind PacketFence to a halt so you want to avoid that at all cost. One way to do so is to increase the number of maximum connections (see above), to periodically flush hosts or to allow more connection errors. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/blocked-host.html for details.

Using Percona XtraBackup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When dealing with a large database, the database backup and maintenance script (`/usr/local/pf/addons/backup-and-maintenance.sh`) which uses mysqldump may create a long lock on your database which may cause service to hang.

This is fixed easily by using Percona XtraBackup which can complete a full database backup without locking your tables.

The installation instructions below are made for CentOS 7 but adjusting them to Debian should only be a matter of installing the proper packages for your MariaDB version.

First install the Percona repository:

  # yum install http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-release/redhat/0.1-3/percona-release-0.1-3.noarch.rpm

Make sure to disable the newly installed repository not to interfere with future updates:

  # sed -i -e 's/^enabled\ \=.*/enabled = 0/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/percona-release.repo

Next, install Percona XtraBackup by manually specifying the Percona repository:

  # yum install percona-xtrabackup --enablerepo=percona-release-`uname -m`

Once this is done, grant the proper rights to the `pf` user (or the one you configured in pf.conf):

  # mysql -u root -p
  MariaDB> GRANT RELOAD, LOCK TABLES, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'pf'@'localhost';
  MariaDB> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Next, run the maintenance script `/usr/local/pf/addons/backup-and-maintenance.sh` and ensure that the following line is part of the output:

  innobackupex: completed OK!

If the backup fails, check `/usr/local/pf/logs/innobackup.log` for details and refer to the Percona XtraBackup documentation for troubleshooting.

NOTE: In the event that you want to stop using Percona XtraBackups for your MariaDB backups, simply uninstall it and the database script will fallback to mysqldump.

Captive Portal Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid captive portal overload due to non-browser HTTP requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default we allow every query to be redirected and reach PacketFence for the captive portal operation. In a lot of cases, this means that a lot of non-user initiated queries reach PacketFence and waste its resources for nothing since they are not from browsers. (iTunes, Windows update, MSN Messenger, Google Desktop, ...).

Since version 4.3 of PacketFence, you can define HTTP filters for Apache from the configuration of PacketFence.

Some rules have been enabled by default, like one to reject requests with no defined user agent. All rules, including some examples, are defined in the configuration file apache_filters.conf.

Filters are defined with at least two blocks. First are the tests. For example:

  [get_ua_is_dalvik]
  filter = user_agent
  method = GET
  operator = match
  value = Dalvik

  [get_uri_not_generate204]
  filter = uri
  method = GET
  operator = match_not
  value = /generate_204

The last block defines the relationship between the tests and the desired action. For example:

  [block_dalvik:get_ua_is_dalvik&get_uri_not_generate204]
  action = 501
  redirect_url =

This filter will return an error code (501) if the user agent is Dalvik and the URI doesn't contain _/generate_204.

Dashboard Optimizations (statistics collection)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The collection and aggregation of statistics in the whisper database can be I/O intensive per moment. This means that it can be beneficial to separate them on another disk even if it is a virtual disk that will share the same underlying physical disk.

First, add a disk in your virtual machine or bare metal server and reboot (this example will use /dev/sdb as the new device.

Make sure packetfence is stopped:

  # service packetfence stop

Create an ext4 partition:

  # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb

Then move the old databases to a backup point:

  # mv /usr/local/pf/var/graphite /usr/local/pf/var/graphite.bak

Mount your new disk and check that it is mounted:

  # echo "/dev/sdb /usr/local/pf/var/graphite             ext4    defaults        1 1" >> /etc/fstab
  # mkdir /usr/local/pf/var/graphite
  # mount -a
  # dh -h

Apply the proper user rights and restore your database from your backup

  # chown pf.pf /usr/local/pf/var/graphite
  # cp -frp /usr/local/pf/var/graphite.bak/* /usr/local/pf/var/graphite/

Start packetfence and make sure your stats are still there and being collected properly. Then remove the backup you made `rm -fr /usr/local/pf/var/graphite.bak/`.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will address specific problems and known solutions.

"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Problem: Internet Explorer 8-10 may raise an "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" error while attempting to access PacketFence administration interface because TLSv1.2 is not activated but required since PacketFence 7.

Solution:

 * PacketFence administration interface is not started:

  # cd /usr/local/pf
  # bin/pfcmd service httpd.admin start


 * It is strongly advised that you update your browser to Internet Explorer 11 or download an alternative.


 * TLSv1.2 needs to be activated manually in Internet Explorer 8-10.

  Within Internet Explorer: click Tools, Internet Options, Advanced and make sure that TLS v1.2 is enabled under the security section. Retry.

Advanced Network Topics
-----------------------

Floating Network Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports floating network devices. A Floating network device is a device for which PacketFence has a different behavior compared to a regular device. This functionality was originally added to support mobile Access Points.

CAUTION: Right now PacketFence only supports floating network devices on Cisco and Nortel switches configured with port-security.

For a regular device, PacketFence put it in the VLAN corresponding to its status (Registration, Quarantine or Regular VLAN) and authorizes it on the port (port-security).

A floating network device is a device that PacketFence does not manage as a regular device.

When a floating network device is plugged, PacketFence will let/allow all the MAC addresses that will be connected to this device (or appear on the port) and if necessary, configure the port as multi-vlan (trunk) and set PVID and tagged VLANs on the port.

When an floating network device is unplugged, PacketFence will reconfigure the port like before it was plugged.

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration:

[options="compact"]
* floating network devices have to be identified using their MAC address.
* linkup/linkdown traps are not enabled on the switches, only port-security traps are.

When PacketFence receives a port-security trap for a floating network device, it changes the port configuration so that:

[options="compact"]
* it disables port-security
* it sets the PVID
* it eventually sets the port as multi-vlan (trunk) and sets the tagged Vlans
* it enables linkdown traps

When PF receives a linkdown trap on a port in which a floating network device was plugged, it changes the port configuration so that:

[options="compact"]
* it enables port-security
* it disables linkdown traps

Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we mentioned earlier, each floating network device has to be identified. There are two ways to do it:

[options="compact"]
* by editing `conf/floating_network_device.conf`
* through the Web GUI, in *Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Floating Device*

Here are the settings that are available:

MAC Address::
  MAC address of the floating device
IP Address::
  IP address of the floating device (not required, for information only)
trunkPort::
  Yes/no. Should the port be configured as a multi-vlan port?
pvid::
  VLAN in which PacketFence should put the port
taggedVlan::
  Comma separated list of VLANs. If the port is a multi-vlan, these are the Vlans that have to be tagged on the port.

Production DHCP access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to perform all of its access control duties, PacketFence needs to be able to map MAC addresses into IP addresses.

For all the networks/VLANs where you want PacketFence to have the ability to isolate a node or to have IP information about nodes, you will need to perform *one* of the techniques below.

Also note that this doesn't need to be done for the registration, isolation VLANs and inline interfaces since PacketFence acts as the DHCP server in these networks.

IP Helpers
^^^^^^^^^^

If you are already using IP Helpers for your production DHCP in your production VLANs this approach is the simplest one and the one that works the best.

Add PacketFence's management IP address as the last `ip helper-address` statement in your network equipment. At this point PacketFence will receive a copy of all DHCP requests for that VLAN and will record what IP were distributed to what node using a `pfdhcplistener` daemon.

By default no DHCP Server should be running on that interface where you are sending the requests. This is by design otherwise PacketFence would reply to the DHCP requests which would be a bad thing.

Obtain a copy of the DHCP traffic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get a copy of all the DHCP Traffic to a dedicated physical interface in the PacketFence server and run `pfdhcplistener` on that interface. It will involve configuring your switch properly to perform port mirroring (aka network span) and adding in PacketFence the proper interface statement at the operating system level and in `pf.conf`.

`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth2`:

  DEVICE=eth2
  ONBOOT=yes
  BOOTPROTO=none

Add to `pf.conf`: (IPs are not important they are there only so that PacketFence will start)

  [interface eth2]
  mask=255.255.255.0
  type=dhcp-listener
  gateway=192.168.1.5
  ip=192.168.1.1

Restart PacketFence and you should be good to go.

Interface in every VLAN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because DHCP traffic is broadcast traffic, an alternative for small networks with few local VLANs is to put a VLAN interface for every VLAN on the PacketFence server and have a `pfdhcplistener` listen on that VLAN interface.

On the network side you need to make sure that the VLAN truly reaches all the way from your client to your DHCP infrastructure up to the PacketFence server.

On the PacketFence side, first you need an operating system VLAN interface like the one below. Stored in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.1010`:

  # Engineering VLAN
  DEVICE=eth0.1010
  ONBOOT=yes
  BOOTPROTO=static
  IPADDR=10.0.101.4
  NETMASK=255.255.255.0
  VLAN=yes

Then you need to specify in `pf.conf` that you are interested in that VLAN's DHCP by setting type to `dhcp-listener`.

  [interface eth0.1010]
  mask=255.255.255.0
  type=dhcp-listener
  gateway=10.0.101.1
  ip=10.0.101.4

Repeat the above for all your production VLANs then restart PacketFence.

Host production DHCP on PacketFence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's an option. Just modify `conf/dhcpd.conf` so that it will host your production DHCP properly and make sure that a `pfdhcplistener` runs on the same interface where production DHCP runs. However, please note that this is *NOT* recommended. See https://packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1050[this ticket] to see why.

Routed Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your isolation and registration networks are not locally-reachable (at layer 2) on the network, but routed to the PacketFence server, you'll have to let the PacketFence server know this. PacketFence can even provide DHCP and DNS in these routed networks and provides an easy to use configuration interface.

image::diagram-routed-net.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Routed network example diagram"]

For dhcpd, make sure that the clients DHCP requests are correctly forwarded (IP Helpers in the remote routers) to the PacketFence server.

If we consider the network architecture illustrated in the above schema, `conf/pf.conf` will include the local registration and isolation interfaces only.

   [interface eth0.2]
   enforcement=vlan
   ip=192.168.2.1
   type=internal
   mask=255.255.255.0

   [interface eth0.3]
   enforcement=vlan
   ip=192.168.3.1
   type=internal
   mask=255.255.255.0

NOTE: PacketFence will not start unless you have at least one 'internal' interface, so you need to create local registration and isolation VLANs even if you don't intend to use them.  Also, the 'internal' interfaces are the only ones on which dhcpd listens, so the remote registration and isolation subnets need to point their DHCP helper-address to those particular IPs.

Then you need to provide the routed networks information to PacketFence. You can do it through the GUI in *Administration -> Networks* (or in `conf/networks.conf`).

`conf/networks.conf` will look like this:

   [192.168.2.0]
   netmask=255.255.255.0
   gateway=192.168.2.1
   next_hop=
   domain-name=registration.example.com
   dns=192.168.2.1
   dhcp_start=192.168.2.10
   dhcp_end=192.168.2.200
   dhcp_default_lease_time=300
   dhcp_max_lease_time=600
   type=vlan-registration
   named=enabled
   dhcpd=enabled

   [192.168.3.0]
   netmask=255.255.255.0
   gateway=192.168.3.1
   next_hop=
   domain-name=isolation.example.com
   dns=192.168.3.1
   dhcp_start=192.168.3.10
   dhcp_end=192.168.3.200
   dhcp_default_lease_time=300
   dhcp_max_lease_time=600
   type=vlan-isolation
   named=enabled
   dhcpd=enabled

   [192.168.20.0]
   netmask=255.255.255.0
   gateway=192.168.20.254
   next_hop=192.168.2.254
   domain-name=registration.example.com
   dns=192.168.2.1
   dhcp_start=192.168.20.10
   dhcp_end=192.168.20.200
   dhcp_default_lease_time=300
   dhcp_max_lease_time=600
   type=vlan-registration
   named=enabled
   dhcpd=enabled

   [192.168.30.0]
   netmask=255.255.255.0
   gateway=192.168.30.254
   next_hop=192.168.3.254
   domain-name=isolation.example.com
   dns=192.168.3.1
   dhcp_start=192.168.30.10
   dhcp_end=192.168.30.200
   dhcp_default_lease_time=300
   dhcp_max_lease_time=600
   type=vlan-isolation
   named=enabled
   dhcpd=enabled


Then you need to enable and start `packetfence-routes` service:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pf updatesystemd
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service routes start
----

`packetfence-routes` service will use this file to add static routes
corresponding to routed networks (192.168.20.0/24 and 192.168.30.0/24) in
PacketFence's server routing table. The `next_hop` statement in each routed
network section defines next hop for such routes.

DHCP clients on the registration and isolation networks receive the PF
server IP as their DNS server (dns=x.x.x.x), and PF spoofs DNS responses to
force clients via the portal.  However, clients could manually configure
their DNS settings to escape the portal.  To prevent this you will need to
apply an ACL on the access router nearest the clients, permitting access
only to the PF server and local DHCP broadcast traffic.

For example, for the VLAN 20 remote registration network:

   ip access-list extended PF_REGISTRATION
    permit ip any host 192.168.2.1
    permit udp any any eq 67
    deny ip any any log
   interface vlan 20
    ip address 192.168.20.254 255.255.255.0
    ip helper-address 192.168.2.1
    ip access-group PF_REGISTRATION in

If your edge switches support 'vlan-isolation' you can also apply the ACL
there.  This has the advantage of preventing machines in isolation from
attempting to attack each other.

Network Devices Definition (switches.conf)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section applies only for VLAN enforcement. Users planning to do inline enforcement only can skip this section.

PacketFence needs to know which switches, access points or controllers it manages, their type and configuration. All this information is stored in `/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`. You can modify the configuration directly in the `switches.conf` file or you can do it from the Web Administration panel under *Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Switches* - which is now the preferred way.

The `/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf` configuration file contains a default section including:

[options="compact"]
* Default SNMP read/write communities for the switches
* Default working mode (see the note below about possible working modes)

and a switch section for each switch (managed by PacketFence) including:

[options="compact"]
* Switch IP/Mac/Range
* Switch vendor/type
* Switch uplink ports (trunks and non-managed IfIndex)
* per-switch re-definition of the VLANs (if required)

NOTE: `switches.conf` is loaded at startup. A reload is required when changes
are manually made to this file `/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload`.

NOTE: All the ports declared as uplinks will be ignored and not managed by PacketFence. This parameter is defined in the [default] section of `switches.conf`. You can define a different uplink list for each switch.

Switch import from CSV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using this, you will able to import a list of switches and update its description and switch group.

NOTE: You must create the switch group prior to importing the switches.

The CSV must have the following format: "description, IP or MAC, switch group". The first line will be skipped. If an entry with one provided IP/MAC already exist it will be updated. 
In order to only define the switch group through the import, leave the description field empty.

Working modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three different working modes for a switch in PacketFence:

Testing::
pfsetvlan writes in the log files what it would normally do, but it doesn't do anything.
Registration::
pfsetvlan automatically-register all MAC addresses seen on the switch ports. As in testing mode, no VLAN changes are done.
Production::
pfsetvlan sends the SNMP writes to change the VLAN on the switch ports.

RADIUS
^^^^^^

To set the RADIUS secret, set it from the Web administrative interface when adding a switch. Alternatively, edit the switch config file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`) and set the following parameters:

  radiusSecret = secretPassPhrase

Moreover, the RADIUS secret is required to support the RADIUS Dynamic Authentication (Change of authorization or Disconnect) as defined in RFC3576.

SNMP v1, v2c and v3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence uses SNMP to communicate with most switches. PacketFence also supports SNMP v3. You can use SNMP v3 for communication in both directions: from the switch to PacketFence and from PacketFence to the switch. SNMP usage is discouraged, you should now use RADIUS. However, even if RADIUS is being used, some switches might also require SNMP to be configured to work properly with PacketFence.

From PacketFence to a switch
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Edit the switch config file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`) and set the following parameters:

  SNMPVersion = 3
  SNMPEngineID = AA5ED139B81D4A328D18ACD1
  SNMPUserNameRead = readUser
  SNMPAuthProtocolRead = MD5
  SNMPAuthPasswordRead = authpwdread
  SNMPPrivProtocolRead = AES
  SNMPPrivPasswordRead = privpwdread
  SNMPUserNameWrite = writeUser
  SNMPAuthProtocolWrite = MD5
  SNMPAuthPasswordWrite = authpwdwrite
  SNMPPrivProtocolWrite = AES
  SNMPPrivPasswordWrite = privpwdwrite

From a switch to PacketFence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Edit the switch config file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`) and set the following parameters:

  SNMPVersionTrap = 3
  SNMPUserNameTrap = readUser
  SNMPAuthProtocolTrap = MD5
  SNMPAuthPasswordTrap = authpwdread
  SNMPPrivProtocolTrap = AES
  SNMPPrivPasswordTrap = privpwdread

Switch Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

Here is a switch configuration example in order to enable SNMP v3 in both directions on a Cisco Switch.

  snmp-server engineID local AA5ED139B81D4A328D18ACD1
  snmp-server group readGroup v3 priv
  snmp-server group writeGroup v3 priv read v1default write v1default
  snmp-server user readUser readGroup v3 auth md5 authpwdread priv aes 128 privpwdread
  snmp-server user writeUser writeGroup v3 auth md5 authpwdwrite priv aes 128 privpwdwrite
  snmp-server enable traps port-security
  snmp-server enable traps port-security trap-rate 1
  snmp-server host 192.168.0.50 version 3 priv readUser  port-security

By default a switch has a SNMPv3 engine identifier (SNMPEngineID), you can get it with `show snmp engineid`.

Test from a PacketFence server
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the `net-snmp` package properly installed, you can test SNMPv3 communication with your switch:

----
snmpget -v3 -l authPriv -u readUser -a MD5 -A "authpwdread" \
-x AES -X "privpwdread" IP_OF_YOUR_SWITCH sysName.0
----

NOTE: Passwords should be at least 8 characters length.

Command-Line Interface: Telnet and SSH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING: Privilege detection is disabled in the current PacketFence version due to some issues (see https://packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1370[#1370]). So make sure that the `cliUser` and `cliPwd` you provide always get you into a privileged mode (except for Trapeze hardware).

PacketFence needs sometimes to establish an interactive command-line session with a switch. This can be done using Telnet. You can also use SSH. In order to do so, edit the switch configuration file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`) and set the following parameters:

  cliTransport = SSH (or Telnet)
  cliUser = admin
  cliPwd = admin_pwd
  cliEnablePwd =

It can also be done through the Web Administration Interface under *Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Switches*.

Web Services Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence sometimes needs to establish a dialog with the Web Services capabilities of a switch. In order to do so, edit the switch config file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`) and set the following parameters:

  wsTransport = http (or https)
  wsUser = admin
  wsPwd = admin_pwd

It can also be done through the Web Administration Interface under *Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Switches*.

Role-based enforcement support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some network devices support the assignment of a specific set of rules (firewall or ACLs) to a user. The idea is that these rules can be a lot more accurate to control what a user can or cannot do compared to VLAN which have a larger network management overhead.

PacketFence supports assigning roles on devices for switches and WiFi controllers that support it. The current role assignment strategy is to assign it along with the VLAN (that may change in the future). A special internal role to external role assignment must be configured in the switch configuration file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`).

The current format is the following:

  Format: <rolename>Role=<controller_role>

And you assign it to the global `roles` parameter or the per-switch one. For example:

  adminRole=full-access
  engineeringRole=full-access
  salesRole=little-access

would return the `full-access` role to the nodes categorized as admin or engineering and the role `little-access` to nodes categorized as sales. It can also be done through the Web Administration Interface under *Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Switches*.


CAUTION: Make sure that the roles are properly defined on the network devices prior to assigning roles!

More on VoIP Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VoIP has been growing in popularity on enterprise networks.  At first sight, the IT administrators think that deploying VoIP with a NAC poses a huge complicated challenge to resolve.  In fact, depending of the hardware you have, not really.  In this section, we will see why.

CDP and LLDP are your friend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For those of you who are unaware of the existence of CDP or LLDP (or LLDP-MED), I suggest you start reading on this topic.  Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is device-discovery protocol that runs on all Cisco-manufactured equipment including routers, access servers, bridges, and switches. Using CDP, a device can advertise its existence to other devices and receive information about other devices on the same LAN or on the remote side of a WAN.  In the world of VoIP, CDP is able to determine if the connecting device is an IP Phone or not, and tell the IP Phone to tag its ethernet frame using the configured voice VLAN on the switchport.

On many other vendors, you are likely to find LLDP or LLDP-MED support.  Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a vendor-neutral Link Layer protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite used by network devices for advertising their identity, capabilities, and neighbors.  Same as CDP, LLDP can tell an IP Phone which VLAN id is the voice VLAN.

VoIP and VLAN assignment techniques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you already know, PacketFence supports many VLAN assignment techniques such as port-security, MAC authentication or 802.1X. Let's see how VoIP is doing with each of those.

Port-security
+++++++++++++

Using port-security, the VoIP device rely on CDP/LLDP to tag its ethernet frame using the configured voice VLAN on the switch port.  After that, we ensure that a security trap is sent from the voice VLAN so that PacketFence can authorize the mac address on the port.  When the PC connects, another security trap will be sent, but from the data VLAN.  That way, we will have 1 mac address authorized on the voice VLAN, and 1 on the access VLAN.

NOTE: Not all vendors support VoIP on port-security, please refer to the Network Configuration Guide.

MAC Authentication and 802.1X
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On Cisco switches, we are looking at the multi-domain configuration.  The multi-domain means that we can have one device on the VOICE domain, and one device on the DATA domain.  The domain assignment is done using a Cisco Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSA).  When the phone connects to the switchport, PacketFence will respond with the proper VSA only, no RADIUS tunneled attributes.  CDP then tells the phone to tag its ethernet frames using the configured voice VLAN on the port.  When a PC connects, the RADIUS server will return tunneled attributes, and the switch will place the port in the provided access VLAN.

On other vendor hardware, it is possible to make VoIP work using RADIUS VSAs.  When a phone connects to a switchport, PacketFence needs to return the proper VSA to tell the switch to allow tagged frames from this device.  When the PC will connect, we will be able to return standard RADIUS tunnel attributes to the switch, that will be the untagged VLAN.

NOTE: Again, refer to the Network Configuration Guide to see if VoIP is supported on your switch hardware.

What if CDP/LLDP feature is missing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible that your phone doesn't support CDP or LLDP.  If it's the case, you are probably looking at the "DHCP way" of provisioning your phone with a voice VLAN.  Some models will ask for a specific DHCP option so that the DHCP server can give the phone a voice VLAN id.  The phone will then reboot, and tag its ethernet frame using the provided VLAN tag.

In order to make this scenario work with PacketFence, you need to ensure that you tweak the registration and your production DHCP server to provide the DHCP option.  You also need to make sure there is a voice VLAN properly configured on the port, and that you auto-register your IP Phones (On the first connect, the phone will be assigned on the registration VLAN).

DHCP Option 82
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence is able to locate a device on the network even if the switch port is not managed by PacketFence.
To use this feature you need to add all the switches in PacketFence and enable SNMP read (switch and PacketFence side) and enable DHCP option 82 in Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Network.
Once enabled, restart the pfdhcplistener and pfmon services.
pfmon will query via SNMP all the switches to create a map (MAC <-> switch)
pfdhcplistener will parse the DHCP Option 82 and will use the map to resolve the MAC to the switch and will update the locationlog of the device.

Additional Integration
----------------------

DHCP Remote Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DHCP remote sensor consists of a lightweight binary that is installed on your production DHCP server in order to replicate the DHCP traffic 1 to 1 to the PacketFence server. This solution is more reliable than the DHCP relaying since PacketFence receives a copy of all your DHCP traffic and not only the broadcasted DHCP traffic. Supported DHCP servers are Microsoft DHCP server and CentOS 6 and 7.

These sensors work by capturing the packets at the lowest level possible on your DHCP server and forward them to the PacketFence management interface

Microsoft DHCP Sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
DHCP-Forwarder is an optimized version of precedent udp-reflector, which installs easily and only copy DHCPREQUESTS and DHCPACK packets to the destination.

https://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/windows-dhcp-forwarder/DHCP%20Forwarder%20Installer.exe[Download the installer here.]

It will install WinPCAP, nssm, launch a configurator to ask for interface, IP and port, save the configuration, install and launch DHCP-Forwarder service.

When you will be asked for a host IP and port, specify PacketFence management IP and 767 as the UDP port.

WARNING: On some versions of Windows, the `getmac` command will return invalid output when running the installer in a language other than English. In order to workaround the issue, change your Windows language to English, then logout/login and run the installer again.

The project page can be found https://github.com/inverse-inc/packetfence-dhcp-forwarder[here].

Linux-based Sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First download the RPM on your DHCP server.

CentOS 6 and 7 servers
++++++++++++++++++++++

For CentOS 6:

----
# for x86_64
# wget http://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/CentOS6/extra/x86_64/RPMS/udp-reflector-1.0-6.1.x86_64.rpm
----

For CentOS 7:

----
# for x86_64
# wget http://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/CentOS7/extra/x86_64/RPMS/udp-reflector-1.0-6.1.x86_64.rpm
----

Now install the sensor:

----
# rpm -i udp-reflector-*.rpm
----

Compiling the sensor from source on a Linux system
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First make sure you have the following packages installed:
[options="compact"]
* libpcap
* libpcap-devel
* gcc-c++

Get the source code of the sensor:

----
# mkdir -p ~/udp-reflector && cd ~/udp-reflector
# wget http://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/udp-reflector/udp_reflector.cpp
# g++ udp_reflector.cpp -o /usr/local/bin/udp_reflector -lpcap
----

Configuring the Sensor
++++++++++++++++++++++

Place the following line in `/etc/rc.local`
[options="compact"]
* where `pcap0` is the pcap interface where your DHCP server listens on. (List them using `udp_reflector -l`)
* where `192.168.1.5` is the management IP of your PacketFence server
----
/usr/local/bin/udp_reflector -s pcap0:67 -d 192.168.1.5:767 -b 25000 &
----

Start the sensor:

----
# /usr/local/bin/udp_reflector -s pcap0:67 -d 192.168.1.5:767 -b 25000 &
----

The DHCP traffic should now be reflected on your PacketFence server.

Active Directory Integration

Deleted Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create the script `unreg_node_deleted_account.ps1` on the Windows Server with the following content. Make sure to change `@IP_PACKETFENCE` to the IP address of your PacketFence server. You'll also need to change the username and password as they must match the credentials defined in the Web admin interface under *Configuration -> Integration -> Web Services*.

Switch Login Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence is able to act as an authentication and authorization service on the port 1815 for granting command-line interface (CLI) access to switches.
PacketFence currently supports Cisco switches and these must be configured using the following guide: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/remote-authentication-dial-user-service-radius/116291-configure-freeradius-00.html. From the PacketFence's web admin interface, you must configure an Admin Access role (*Configuration->System Configuration->Admin Access*) that contains the action 'Switches CLI - Read' or 'Switches CLI - Write' and assign this role to an internal user or in an Administration rule in an internal source.

Then you need to enable `_CLI Access Enabled_` setting on switch(s) you want to manage in 'Configuration -> Network devices -> Switches'.

NOTE: Any user that has the 'ALL' administrative role will be able to login into your switches. If you want to provide all PacketFence administrative access to some users without allowing them to login into the switches, then apply the 'ALL_PF_ONLY' administrative role which will contains all the necessary PacketFence roles without the switch login.


Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section has been created to give a quick start to configure the Cisco MSE with PacketFence.
In the first part we will explain how to use the Cisco MSE in order to present a captive
portal based on the localization.
Then in the second part we will integrate the device localization in the node view.

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^

* You have at least one server with PacketFence 6.3 or later.
* The PacketFence management IP will be 192.168.1.5.
* An account has been created on the MSE in order to use RESTful API of the MSE. (Read only for localization , write to create notifications)
* The Cisco MSE IP will be 192.168.1.6.

Portal Based on Localization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable httpd.collector service on PacketFence
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This service is mandatory and will receive the mse notifications in json format.
To enable this service go in `Configuration -> services` and tick services.httpd_collector and leave the default order.

image::httpd_collector.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Enable httpd_collector"]

Create a Notification
+++++++++++++++++++++

This part can be done directly on the MSE web admin GUI but we include a Perl script in addons/mse-subscribe.pl that will help you to create one using the RESTful API of the MSE.

So let say that you have a username with write permissions on the MSE (mswrite/password) now go in /usr/local/pf/addons then run:

 ./mse-subscribe.pl --username=msewrite --password=password --url=http://192.168.1.6:8083 --target-ip=192.168.1.5 --target-port=9292 --url-path=/mse/ --zone=Campus>Building>Level>Zone --notification-name=Zone1

This will create the notification and print out the notifications configured on the MSE.
So now each time a device will enter or leave the specific zone PacketFence will be notified.

Configure a Portal Filter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In *Configuration Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles -> Add profile -> Advanced filter* specify an advanced filter like that:

 extended.mse_inout.locationMapHierarchy == "Campus>Building>Level>Zone"

image::Connection_filter.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Connection Filter"]

And fill the other configuration needed to configure a connection profile then save it.

That's all, now when a device will hit the captive portal and will be in the specific zone then
it will hit this connection profile.

MSE Tab
^^^^^^^

This configuration is really simple, you just have to enable and fill the URL, the username and password in *Configuration -> Integration -> Cisco Mobility Service Engine*.
So in our example:

 URL: http://192.168.1.6:8083
 Username: mseread
 Password: password

image::MSE_Tab.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="MSE Tab"]

Now go in `Nodes` and click on a MAC address and you will see that a new tab appears, then if you click on it you will be able to retrieve the map and the localization of the device.

Monit
~~~~~

`monit` is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations. E.g. Monit can start a process if it does not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if it uses too much resources.

For further reference the monit documentation is available at: https://mmonit.com/monit/documentation/monit.html

Install Monit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following must be done on each server of a cluster

RHEL / CentOS

----
yum install monit --enablerepo=packetfence-extra -y
----

Debian

----
apt-get update
apt-get install monit
----


Fetch the script signing key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
----
gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys E3A28334
----


Download the Packetfence monit addons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The monit addons are included with Packetfence at
`/usr/local/pf/addons/monit`. This step is only needed if you want to upgrade
the scripts to the latest version without having to upgrade Packetfence. This
means that you can have unexpected behaviors due to difference between
PacketFence configuration and monit checks.

----
cd /tmp/ && wget http://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/monitoring-scripts/v1/monit.tgz && tar xzvf monit.tgz
----

Replace the monit addons directory

----
mv /usr/local/pf/addons/monit /usr/local/pf/addons/monit.old ; mv /tmp/monit /usr/local/pf/addons/
----


Generate the monit configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
----
/usr/local/pf/addons/monit/monit_build_configuration.pl 'email(s)' 'subject' 'configurations' 'mailserver'
----

Where :
[options="compact"]
* `email(s)`: CSV (no spaces) of recipient email addresses to send alerts.
* `subject`: Email subject line prefix (example: 'Server 1'). Using a host identifier is useful when running multiple instances (cluster).
* `configuration(s)`: CSV (no spaces) of configurations (example: 'packetfence,active-active,os-checks').
** `packetfence`: Everything related to basic PacketFence
** `portsec`: Will add some checks for port-security related services
** `drbd`: Will add some checks for DRBD
** `active-active`: Will add some checks for active-active clustering related services
** `os-winbind`: Will add a check for the operating system winbindd process. Use it when the winbind/samba configuration is made outside PacketFence
** `os-checks`: Will add some OS best-practices checks
* `mailserver`: SMTP server, use _localhost_ if a SMTP relay is not required.

CAUTION: A MTA is needed to correctly relay emails from monit. If _localhost_ is used as `mailserver`, make sure that a MTA is installed and configured on the server. 

NOTE: This command will create configuration scripts in `/etc/monit.d/`, but it will not remove old(er) scripts from an earlier installation. During an upgrade any unused `/etc/monit.d/*.conf` files will need to be removed manually.


Include the generated configurations in the monit config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the bottom of `/etc/monit.conf` add the line `include /etc/monit.d/*.conf` either manually, or using `sed`:


RHEL / CentOS

----
sed -i -e 's/^include.*//g' /etc/monit.conf && echo "include /etc/monit.d/*.conf" >> /etc/monit.conf
----

Debian

----
sed -i -e 's/include.*\*$//g' /etc/monit/monitrc && echo "include /etc/monit/conf.d/*.conf" >> /etc/monit/monitrc
----

Remove the old monit script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This step is only required during an upgrade from earlier versions.
----
rm /etc/monit.d/packetfence.monit
----

Run the monitoring script update to fetch the scripts and config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This script will download **latest** shell scripts run by monit checks.

RHEL / CentOS

----
yum install uuid -y
/usr/local/pf/addons/monit/monitoring-scripts/update.sh
----

Debian

----
apt-get install uuid-runtime
/usr/local/pf/addons/monit/monitoring-scripts/update.sh
----

Ensure the script outputs: `Update completed successfully`


Ensure the pf group can write the logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
----
chmod g+w /usr/local/pf/logs/*
----

Run the monitoring scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
----
/usr/local/pf/addons/monit/monitoring-scripts/run-all.sh
----

Ensure this script outputs `No error to report`

Error: Syslog is not in asynchronous mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This step is only required if a `Syslog is not in asynchronous mode` error is received above.

In `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, replace:
----
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages
----

with (a hyphen):
----
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                -/var/log/messages
----

Ignore some checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Put full paths of checks in `/etc/monit.d/local-ignores`

Enable and start monit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable monit on startup

----
systemctl enable monit
----

Start monit

----
systemctl restart monit
----

Installing a MTA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A MTA is needed to correctly relay emails from monit. If _localhost_ is used as smtpserver, make sure that a MTA is installed and configured on the server. 

RHEL / CentOS

----
yum install mailx -y
----

Debian

----
apt-get install heirloom-mailx
----

Test the MTA
^^^^^^^^^^^^
----
echo `hostname` | mail -s "Monit test" user@example.com
----


Monit Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

View the monit summary to ensure all services are status `Running`, `Accessible`, or `Status ok`. Address any services that display any other failed status. Monit will display the services in the same order that they are processed. If the summary appears stuck, troubleshoot the next service in the list.

----
monit summary
----

NOTE: `patch` updates only once a week. It is normal to see status `Waiting`.

TIP: More information on the monit command line arguments is available at https://mmonit.com/monit/documentation/monit.html


packetfence-etcd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This step is only needed if `monit summary` is stuck `Waiting` on `packetfence-etcd`. This error indicates that the cluster is currently in 'Failure during bootstrapping'. Please follow the instructions in the PacketFence Clustering Guide on how to resolve this. 

TIP: More information on `etcd` failures can be found at https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/failures.md


== Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced topics in PacketFence. Note that it is also possible to configure PacketFence manually using its configuration files instead of its Web administrative interface. It is still recommended to use the Web interface.

In any case, the `/usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf` file contains the PacketFence general configuration. For example, this is the place where we inform PacketFence it will work in VLAN isolation mode.

All the default parameters and their descriptions are stored in `/usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf.defaults`.

In order to override a default parameter, define it and set it in `pf.conf`.

`/usr/local/pf/conf/documentation.conf` holds the complete list of all available parameters.

All these parameters are also accessible through the web-based administration interface under the Configuration tab. It is highly recommended that you use the web-based administration interface of PacketFence for any configuration changes.

=== Dynamic Reports

Using the `report.conf` configuration file, you can define reports that create
SQL queries to view tables in the PacketFence database. These reports will
appear under the 'Reports -> Dynamic Reports' menu of the administration
interface.

In order to configure a report, you need to edit `/usr/local/pf/conf/report.conf` and add a section that will define your report. Then do a `/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard`.

The following attributes are available to define your report (the ones that have an asterisk are mandatory):
[options="compact"]
* * `type`: Determines what type of report this is. Setting `type=built-in` will make this report appear in _Other reports_, omitting it will display it in _Dynamic reports_ when viewing it in the administration interface. When in doubt, simply omit this parameter.
* * `description` : The user friendly description that will display for this report
* * `base_table` : The base SQL table that will be used to create the view
* * `columns` : The columns to select from the table(s) (ex: `node.mac`).
* * `date_field` : The field to use for date filtering. Will also be used as default sorting field unless `order_fields` is set in the report.
* `joins` : The tables to join to the base table and how to join them. See example below and http://search.cpan.org/~dami/SQL-Abstract-More-1.28/lib/SQL/Abstract/More.pm#Join_specifications[the following documentation].
* `group_field` : The field to group the entries by. No grouping is done if this field is omitted or empty.
* `order_fields` : Comma delimited fields for the ordering of the report. The field should be prefixed of `-` if the sort should be made in descending order for the field (ex: `-node.regdate,locationlog.start_time,+iplog.start_time`).
* `base_conditions` : Comma delimited conditions that should be applied to the report. This can be used to filter the report without using the search in the administration interface to provide the proper unsearched view. Conditions should match the following format : `field:operator:value` (ex: `auth_log.source:=:sms,auth_log.status:!=:completed`).
* `base_conditions_operator` : Whether the base conditions should be matched using an all or any logic. Accepted values are `all` and `any`.
* `person_fields` : The fields in your report that represent a user in the PacketFence database. Field values in this field will be clickable and will allow to view/modify the values of the user in question. The fields must be listed with the name they have in the report header without any quotes and are comma delimited.
* `node_fields` : The fields in your report that represent a node in the PacketFence database. Field values in this field will be clickable and will allow to view/modify the values of the node in question. The fields must be listed with the name they have in the report header without any quotes and are comma delimited.
* `searches` : Comma delimited searches that should be available on the report. Should match the following format `type:Display Name:field` (ex: `string:Username:auth_log.pid`).
[options="compact"]
** `type` defines the type of the search, the only one currently supported is `string`.
** `Display Name` is the user friendly name of the field for display.
** `field` is the SQL name of the field to search

WARNING: Replace operators `IS` and `<>` by `=` and `!=`, respectively.

NOTE: You should always prefix the fields with the table name and a dot (ex: `node.mac`, `locationlog.role`, ...) so that they are not ambiguous. Although your query may work with a single table, it will not if you decide to add joins that contain column name(s) that are the same as the base table.

==== Examples

View of the auth_log table:

  [auth_log]
  description=Authentication report
  # The table to search from
  base_table=auth_log
  # The columns to select
  columns=auth_log.*
  # The date field that should be used for date ranges
  date_field=attempted_at
  # The mac field is a node in the database
  node_fields=mac
  # Allow searching on the PID displayed as Username
  searches=string:Username:auth_log.pid

In this simple example, you will be able to select the whole content of the `auth_log` table and use the date range on the `attempted_at` field as well as search on the `pid` field when viewing the report.

View of the opened security events:

  [open_security_events]
  description=Open security events 
  # The table to search from
  base_table=security_event
  # The columns to select
  columns=security_event.vid as "Security event ID", security_event.mac as "MAC Address", class.description as "Security event description", node.computername as "Hostname", node.pid as "Username", node.notes as "Notes", locationlog.switch_ip as "Last switch IP", security_event.start_date as "Opened on"
  # Left join node, locationlog on the MAC address and class on the security event ID
  joins=<<EOT
  =>{security_event.mac=node.mac} node|node
  =>{security_event.mac=locationlog.mac} locationlog|locationlog
  =>{security_event.vid=class.vid} class|class
  EOT
  date_field=start_date
  # filter on open locationlog entries or null locationlog entries via the end_date field
  base_conditions_operator=any
  base_conditions=locationlog.end_time:=:0000-00-00,locationlog.end_time:IS:
  # The MAC Address field represents a node
  node_fields=MAC Address
  # The Username field represents a user
  person_fields=Username

In the example above, you can see that the security_event table is 'left joined' to the class, node and locationlog tables. Using that strategy we make sure all the security events are listed even on deleted nodes. Then, base conditions are added to filter out outdated locationlog entries as well as include devices without locationlog entries. Removing those conditions would lead to duplicate entries being shown since the report would reflect all the historical locationlog entries.

=== Admin Access

You can manage which access you give to PacketFence administrators. To do that go through 'Configuration->System Configuration->Admin Access'. Then go to your source which authenticate administrator and create an 'administration' rule and assign the wanted Admin role. This functionality allows you to have a granular control on which section of the admin interface is available to whom.

==== Built-in roles

 * ALL: Provides the user with all the admin roles without any exception.
 * ALL_PF_ONLY: Provides the user with all the admin roles related to the PacketFence deployment (excludes switch login rights).
 * Node Manager: Provides the user the ability to manage the nodes.
 * User Manager: Provides the user the ability to manage other users.
 * Security Event Manager: Provides the user the ability to manage the security events (trigger, open, close) for the nodes.

=== Guest pre-registration

Pre-registration is disabled by default. Once enabled, PacketFence's firewall and Apache ACLs allow access to the `/signup` page on the portal even from a remote location. All that should be required from the administrators is to open up their perimeter firewall to allow access to PacketFence's management interface IP on port 443 and make sure a domain name to reach said IP is configured (and that the SSL cert matches it). Then you can promote the pre-registration link from your extranet web site: https://<hostname>/signup.

To minimally configure guest pre-registration, you must make sure that the following statement is set under `[guests_self_registration]` in `/usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf`:

  [guests_self_registration]
  preregistration=enabled

This parameter should be configured from the *Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles -> Profile Name* section.

CAUTION: A valid MTA configured in PacketFence is needed to correctly relay emails related to the guest module. If _localhost_ is used as smtpserver, make sure that a MTA is installed and configured on the server.

CAUTION: Pre-registration increases the attack surface of the PacketFence system since a subset of it's functionality is exposed on the Internet. Make sure you understand the risks, apply the critical operating system updates and apply PacketFence's security fixes.

NOTE: A 'portal' interface type is required to use this feature. A 'portal' interface type can be added to any network interface using the web admin GUI.


=== Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

The Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header tells modern browsers what can be accessed from a generated web page. The default policy is pushed for both the captive portal and the admin interfaces and enforces that everything the browser executes comes from within PacketFence, with the exception of the configured network detection host that is by default the Inverse IP address.

If, for some reason the portal is modified with content that needs to be accessed from PacketFence generated web pages, CSP can be deactivated through *Configuration -> System Configuration -> Main Configuration -> Advanced -> CSP Security Headers*.


=== `pfacct`: track bandwidth usage

Starting from v10, `pfacct` daemon is used to track bandwidth usage of nodes using <<_radius_accounting>> or NetFlow traffic (inline networks only).
It is enabled by default and replaced `packetfence-radiusd-acct` service.

`pfacct` will store data into `bandwidth_accounting` table. Using a security
event with a bandwidth limit trigger, you can limit data usage of your
nodes. GUI also use `bandwidth_accounting` table informations to display
online/offline status of nodes.

Bandwidth usage reports are available in _Reports_ menu under _Accounting_ section.

==== NetFlow traffic on inline networks

NetFlow traffic can be handle by `pfacct` on inline L2/L3 networks. You need
to enable _Netflow Accounting Enabled_ setting when defining an inline network.

In order to not conflict with the `fingerbank-collector` (which listens
NetFlow traffic on all interfaces), `pfacct` listens NetFlow traffic on
localhost, using `udp/2056` port. It received data using NetFlow kernel
module.

pfcmd
~~~~~

`pfcmd` is the command line interface to most PacketFence functionalities.

When executed without any arguments `pfcmd` returns a basic help message with all main options:

[appendix]
Restoring a Percona XtraBackup dump
-----------------------------------

If you enabled Percona XtraBackup for your nightly backup, you can use the following instructions to restore it. In this example we will be restoring `/root/backup/packetfence-db-dump-innobackup-2016-12-20_00h31.xbstream.gz`

First, create a restore directory, move the backup to it and gunzip the backup:

  # mkdir /root/backup/restore
  # cd /root/backup/restore
  # cp ../packetfence-db-dump-innobackup-2016-12-20_00h31.xbstream.gz .
  # gunzip packetfence-db-dump-innobackup-2016-12-20_00h31.xbstream.gz

Then extract the xbstream data:

  # xbstream -x < packetfence-db-dump-innobackup-2016-12-20_00h31.xbstream

Once done, you should have a lot of files that were extracted in the restore dir. Now, lets place the xbstream back in the backup directory

  # mv packetfence-db-dump-innobackup-2016-12-20_00h31.xbstream ../

Next, install qpress (available from the percona repository) and process any qp file that were extracted:

CentOS:

  # yum install qpress --enablerepo=percona-release-`uname -m`
  # for i in $(find -name "*.qp"); do qpress -vd $i $(dirname ${i}) && rm -f $i; done


Debian:

  # apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1C4CBDCDCD2EFD2A
  # echo 'deb http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  # echo 'deb-src http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get install qpress
  # for i in $(find -name "*.qp"); do qpress -vd $i $(dirname ${i}) && rm -f $i; done

Next, apply the innodb log:

  # innobackupex --apply-log ./

We will now stop MariaDB, move the existing data directory and replace it by the data that was extracted:

NOTE: Make sure you adjust the commands above to your environment.

  # service packetfence-mariadb stop
  # mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql.bak
  # mkdir /var/lib/mysql
  # mv * /var/lib/mysql
  # chown -R mysql: /var/lib/mysql
  # service packetfence-mariadb start

Should the service fail to start, make sure you look into the MariaDB error logs.

[appendix]
How to restore a standalone PacketFence server ?
------------------------------------------------

For the restore procedure, we make the following assumptions:

- database `pf` removed (but user `pf` still presents in DB)
- `/usr/local/pf` removed

Procedure:
----
# cd /root/backup/
# BACKUP_FILES=packetfence-files-dump-2018-10-01_00h30.tgz
# BACKUP_DB_FILE=packetfence-db-dump-2018-10-01_00h30.sql.gz
----

Reinstall PacketFence (to avoid creating var directories by hand):

 # yum reinstall packetfence --enablerepo=packetfence

Restore files (overwrite packages files):

 # tar x -vf $BACKUP_FILES -C /

Generate the new configuration:
----
# /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd fixpermissions
# /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd pfconfig clear_backend
# systemctl restart packetfence-redis-cache
# systemctl restart packetfence-config
# /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard
----

Create the database:
----
# gzip -d $BACKUP_DB_FILE
# mysql -u root -p -e "create database pf;"
# mysql -u root -p pf < /usr/local/pf/db/pf-schema-YOUR.PF.VERSION.sql
----

Restore the database dump (filename without .gz extension):
----
# mysql -u root -p pf < ${BACKUP_DB_FILE%.*}
# systemctl restart packetfence-mariadb
----

Restart PacketFence:

 # /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pf restart
