      description: This allows already registered users to be able to re-register
        their device by first accessing the status page and then accessing the portal.

    always_use_redirecturl:
      description: Under most circumstances we can redirect the user to the URL he
        originally intended to visit. However, you may prefer to force the captive
        portal to redirect the user to the redirection URL.
      type: string
    autoregister:
      description: This activates automatic registation of devices for the profile.
        Devices will not be shown a captive portal and RADIUS authentication credentials
        will be used to register the device. This option only makes sense in the context
        of an 802.1x authentication.

    preregistration:
      description: This activates preregistration on the connection profile. Meaning,
        instead of applying the access to the currently connected device, it displays
        a local account that is created while registering. Note that activating this
        disables the on-site registration on this connection profile. Also, make sure
        the sources on the connection profile have "Create local account" enabled.

    reuse_dot1x_credentials:
      description: This option emulates SSO when someone needs to face the captive
        portal after a successful 802.1x connection. 802.1x credentials are reused
        on the portal to match an authentication and get the appropriate actions.
        As a security precaution, this option will only reuse 802.1x credentials if
        there is an authentication source matching the provided realm. This means,
        if users use 802.1x credentials with a domain part (username@domain, domain\username),
        the domain part needs to be configured as a realm under the RADIUS section
        and an authentication source needs to be configured for that realm. If users
        do not use 802.1x credentials with a domain part, only the NULL realm will
        be match IF an authentication source is configured for it.
