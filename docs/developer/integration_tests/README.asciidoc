=== Integration tests

The aim of integration tests is to test common PacketFence scenarios and
integrations in a pipeline.

Integration tests rely on:

* <<_virtual_environment>>
* a network topology built using `libvirt` footnote:[based on Cumulus Networks's project link:https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant[cldemo]]
* virtual machines different than PacketFence to test integrations

==== Network Topology

.Integration tests topology
image::integration_tests/integration_tests_topology.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Integration tests topology"]

This topology require a working `libvirt` setup (Virtualbox is not supported) and is defined as
Infrastructure-as-code in two
link:https://github.com/inverse-inc/packetfence/tree/devel/addons/vagrant/[Vagrantfiles].

===== Initial Provisioning

`switch01` and `node01` are provisioned using Vagrant like this:

* a first boot with basic shell provisioning to configure interfaces remap and networks
* a second boot that handles interface remap
* an Ansible provisioning

Provisioning is deliberately minimalist to make the most during integration tests.

Management network is used to provision each virtual machine using Ansible to
put them in a desired state.

==== Virtual machines

===== Active Directory Server

Virtual machine called `ad` will be auto-provisioned with:

* a DNS domain
* an Active Directory domain
* Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) with auto-enrollment using a GPO
* a `vagrant-domain` account, member of Domain admins group, with `VagrantPass1` as password
* a `packetfence` account, member of Domain users group, with `P@ck3tF3nc3pass` as password

Several reboots are necessary before machine can be provisioned by
Ansible. During initial Ansible provisioning, several reboots will
occur too. It takes like 10 minutes to have a machine up and running.

===== Switch01

`switch01` is a virtual switch that uses link:https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/[Cumulus Linux 3.7] system.

This switch is configured using a
link:https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/[VLAN
aware-bridge] to manage VLAN on interfaces (recommended approach)

`hostapd` is the daemon responsible to send 802.1X and MAC Authentication
requests to RADIUS server (as described in
link:https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-1-and-Switch-Ports/802.1X-Interfaces/[802.1X
Cumulus Linux documentation]). We configured this daemon using Ansible with RADIUS server informations.
However, daemon will be started during integration tests when switch interfaces are involved.

===== Node01

`node01` is a Debian Buster virtual machine used as node to test PacketFence
features like 802.1X, MAC authentification, registration, isolation and inline
scenarios.

This machine has an Internet access during its first boot. After the reboot, this machine is only
reachable using management network. A `vagrant ssh node01` will not work.

All interfaces of `node01` are up after initial provisionning. We rely on
`switch01` configuration to trigger specific scenario.
