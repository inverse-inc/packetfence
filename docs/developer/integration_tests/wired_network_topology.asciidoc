==== Wired network topology

===== Initial Provisioning

`switch01` and `node01` are provisioned using Vagrant like this:

* a first boot with basic shell provisioning to configure interfaces remap and networks
* a second boot that handles interface remap
* an Ansible provisioning

Provisioning is deliberately minimalist to make the most during integration tests.
