//== Supported Enforcement Modes

Prior configuring PacketFence, you must chose an appropriate enforcement mode to be used by PacketFence with your networking equipment. The enforcement mode is the technique used to enforce registration and any subsequent access of devices on your network. PacketFence supports the following enforcement modes:

[options="compact"]
* Inline
* Out-of-band using SNMP or RADIUS
* Hostpot-style (or Web Auth)
* RADIUS only
* DNS

It is also possible to combine enforcement modes. For example, you could use the out-of-band mode on your wired switches, while using the inline mode on your old WiFi access points.

The following sections will explain these enforcement modes. It will also explain how to properly configure PacketFence to use each enforcement mode.

=== Technical Introduction to Inline Enforcement

==== Introduction

In many other NAC solutions, it is not possible to support unmanageable devices such as entry-level consumer switches or access-points. Using PacketFence, with the new inline mode, it can be use in-band for those devices. So in other words, PacketFence would become the gateway of that inline network, and NAT or route the traffic using IPTables/IPSet to the Internet (or to another section of the network). Let see how it works.

==== Device Configuration

No special configuration is needed on the unmanageable device. That's the beauty. You only need to ensure that the device is "talking" on the inline VLAN. At this point, all the traffic will be passing through PacketFence since it is the gateway for this VLAN.

==== Access Control

The access control relies entirely on IPTables/IPSet. When a user is not registered, and connects in the inline VLAN, PacketFence will give him an IP address. At this point, the user will be marked as unregistered in the ipset session, and all the Web traffic will be redirected to the captive portal and other traffic blocked. The user will have to register through the captive portal as in VLAN enforcement. When he registers, PacketFence changes the device's ipset session to allow the user's mac address to go through it.

==== Limitations

Inline enforcement, because of it's nature, has several limitations that you must be aware of.

[options="compact"]
* Everyone behind an inline interface is on the same Layer 2 LAN
* Every packet of authorized users goes through the PacketFence server increasing the server's load considerably: Plan ahead for capacity
* Every packet of authorized users goes through the PacketFence server: it is a single point of failure for Internet access
* Ipset can store up to 65536 entries, so it is not possible to have an inline network class greater than a class B

This is why it is considered a poor man's way of doing access control. We have avoided it for a long time because of the above mentioned limitations. That said, being able to perform both inline and VLAN enforcement on the same server at the same time is a real advantage: it allows admins to maintain maximum security while they deploy new and more capable network hardware providing a clean migration path to VLAN enforcement.

=== Technical Introduction to Out-of-band Enforcement

==== Introduction

VLAN assignment is currently performed using several different techniques. These techniques are compatible one to another, but not on the same switch port. This means that you can use the more secure and modern techniques for your latest switches and another technique on the old switches that doesn't support latest techniques. As it's name implies, VLAN assignment means that PacketFence is the server that assigns the VLAN to a device. This VLAN can be one of your VLANs or it can be a special VLAN where PacketFence presents the captive portal for authentication or remediation.

VLAN assignment effectively isolate your hosts at the OSI Layer2 meaning that it is the trickiest method to bypass and is the one which adapts best to your environment since it glues into your current VLAN assignment methodology.

==== VLAN assignment techniques

===== Wired: 802.1X + MAC Authentication

802.1X provides port-based authentication, which involves communications between a supplicant, authenticator (known as NAS), and authentication server (known as AAA). The supplicant is often software on a client device, such as a laptop, the authenticator is a wired Ethernet switch or wireless access point, and the authentication server is generally a RADIUS server.

The supplicant (i.e., client device) is not allowed access through the authenticator to the network until the supplicant’s identity is authorized. With 802.1X port-based authentication, the supplicant provides credentials, such as user name / password or digital certificate, to the authenticator, and the authenticator forwards the credentials to the authentication server for verification. If the credentials are valid (in the authentication server database), the supplicant (client device) is allowed to access the network. The protocol for authentication is called Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) which have many variants. Both supplicant and authentication servers need to speak the same EAP protocol. Most popular EAP variant is PEAP-MsCHAPv2 (supported by Windows / Mac OSX / Linux for authentication against AD).

In this context, PacketFence runs the authentication server (a FreeRADIUS instance) and will return the appropriate VLAN to the switch. A module that integrates in FreeRADIUS does a remote call to the PacketFence server to obtain that information. More and more devices have 802.1X supplicant which makes this approach more and more popular.

MAC Authentication is a new mechanism introduced by some switch vendor to handle the cases where a 802.1X supplicant does not exist. Different vendors have different names for it. Cisco calls it MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), Juniper calls it MAC RADIUS, Extreme Networks calls it Netlogin, etc. After a timeout period, the switch will stop trying to perform 802.1X and will fallback to MAC Authentication. It has the advantage of using the same approach as 802.1X except that the MAC address is sent instead of the user name and there is no end-to-end EAP conversation (no strong authentication). Using MAC Authentication, devices like network printer or non-802.1X capable IP Phones can still gain access to the network and the right VLAN.

===== Wireless: 802.1X + MAC authentication

Wireless 802.1X works like wired 802.1X and MAC authentication is the same as wired MAC Authentication. Where things change is that the 802.1X is used to setup the security keys for encrypted communication (WPA2-Enterprise) while MAC authentication is only used to authorize (allow or disallow) a MAC on the wireless network.

On wireless networks, the usual PacketFence setup dictate that you configure two SSIDs: an open one and a secure one. The open one is used to help users configure the secure one properly and requires authentication over the captive portal (which runs in HTTPS).

The following diagram demonstrates the flow between a mobile endpoint, a WiFi access point, a WiFi controller and PacketFence:

image::radius-workflow.png["WiFi RADIUS workflow",width="75%",scaledwidth="100%"]

1. User initiates association to WLAN AP and transmits MAC address.  If user accesses network via a registered device in PacketFence, go to step 8.
2. The WLAN controller transmits MAC address via RADIUS to the PacketFence server to authenticate/authorize that MAC address on the AP.
3. PacketFence server conducts address audit in its database.  If it does not recognize the MAC address, go to step 4. If it does, go to step 8.
4. PacketFence server directs WLAN controller via RADIUS (RFC2868 attributes) to put the device in an "unauthenticated role“ (set of ACLs that would limit/redirect the user to the PacketFence captive portal for registration, or we can also use a registration VLAN in which PacketFence does DNS blackholing and is the DHCP server).
5. The user's device issues a DHCP/DNS request to PacketFence (which is a DHCP/DNS server on this VLAN or for this role) which sends the IP and DNS information.  At this point, ACLs are limiting/redirecting the user to the PacketFence's captive portal for authentication.  PacketFence fingerprints the device (user-agent attributes, DHCP information & MAC address patterns) to which it can take various actions including:  keep device on registration portal, direct to alternate captive portal, auto-register the device, auto-block the device, etc.    If the device remains on the registration portal the user registers by providing the information (username/password, cell phone number, etc.).  At this time PacketFence could also require the device to go through a posture assessment (using Nessus, OpenVAS, etc.).
6. If authentication is required (username/password) through a login form, those credentials are validated via the Directory server (or any other authentication sources - like LDAP, SQL, RADIUS, SMS, Facebook, Google+, etc.) which provides user attributes to PacketFence which creates user+device policy profile in its database.
7. PacketFence performs a Change of Authorization (RFC3576) on the controller and the user must be re-authenticated/reauthorized, so we go back to step 1.
8. PacketFence server directs WLAN controller via RADIUS to put the device in an "authenticated role“, or in the "normal" VLAN.


===== Web Authentication Mode

Web authentication is a method on the switch that forwards HTTP traffic of the device to the captive portal.
With this mode, your device will never change of VLAN ID but only the ACL associated to your device will change.
Refer to the Network Devices Configuration Guide to see a sample web auth configuration on a Cisco WLC.

===== Port-security and SNMP

Relies on the port-security SNMP Traps. A fake static MAC address is assigned to all the ports this way any MAC address will generate a security violation and a trap will be sent to PacketFence. The system will authorize the MAC and set the port in the right VLAN. VoIP support is possible but tricky. It varies a lot depending on the switch vendor. Cisco is well supported but isolation of a PC behind an IP Phone leads to an interesting dilemma: either you shut the port (and the phone at the same time) or you change the data VLAN but the PC doesn't do DHCP (didn't detect link was down) so it cannot reach the captive portal.

Aside from the VoIP isolation dilemma, it is the technique that has proven to be reliable and that has the most switch vendor support.

==== More on SNMP traps VLAN isolation

When the VLAN isolation is working through SNMP traps all switch ports (on which VLAN isolation should be done) must be configured to send SNMP traps to the PacketFence host. On PacketFence, we use `snmptrapd` as the SNMP trap receiver. As it receives traps, it reformats and sends them into a redis queue, managed by `pfqueue` service. The multiprocessed `pfqueue` service reads these traps from the redis queue and takes a decision based on type of traps. For example, it can respond to them by setting the switch port to the correct VLAN. Currently, we support switches from Cisco, Edge-Core, HP, Intel, Linksys and Nortel (adding support for switches from another vendor implies extending the `pf::Switch` class). Depending on your switches capabilities, `pfqueue` will act on different types of SNMP traps.

image::diagram-trap-interaction.png[pfqueue SNMP interactions diagram, 400]

You need to create a registration VLAN (with a DHCP server, but no routing to other VLANs) in which PacketFence will put unregistered devices. If you want to isolate computers which have open security event in a separate VLAN, an isolation VLAN needs also to be created.

===== Link Changes (deprecated)

When a host connects to a switch port, the switch sends a linkUp trap to PacketFence. Since it takes some time before the switch learns the MAC address of the newly connected device, PacketFence immediately puts the port in the Registration VLAN in which the device will send DHCP requests in order for the switch to learn its MAC address. Then `pfqueue` will send periodical SNMP queries to the switch until the switch learns the MAC of the device. When the MAC address is known, `pfqueue` checks its status (existing ? registered ? any security event?) in the database and puts the port in the appropriate VLAN. When a device is unplugged, the switch sends a 'linkDown' trap to PacketFence which puts the port into the Registration VLAN.

When a computer boots, the initialization of the NIC generates several link status changes. And every time the switch sends a linkUp and a linkDown trap to PacketFence. Since PacketFence has to act on each of these traps, this generates unfortunately some unnecessary load on `pfqueue`. In order to optimize the trap treatment, PacketFence stops every thread for a 'linkUp trap' when it receives a 'linkDown' trap on the same port. But using only linkUp/linkDown traps is not the most scalable option. For example in case of power failure, if hundreds of computers boot at the same time, PacketFence would receive a lot of traps almost instantly and this could result in network connection latency.

===== MAC Notification Traps (deprecated)

If your switches support MAC notification traps (MAC learned, MAC removed), we suggest that you activate them in addition to the linkUp/linkDown traps. This way, `pfqueue` does not need, after a linkUp trap, to query the switch continuously until the MAC has finally been learned. When it receives a linkUp trap for a port on which MAC notification traps are also enabled, it only needs to put the port in the Registration VLAN and can then free the process. When the switch learns the MAC address of the device it sends a MAC learned trap (containing the MAC address) to PacketFence.

===== Port Security Traps

In its most basic form, the Port Security feature remembers the MAC address connected to the switch port and allows only that MAC address to communicate on that port. If any other MAC address tries to communicate through the port, port security will not allow it and send a port-security trap.

If your switches support this feature, *we strongly recommend to use it rather than linkUp/linkDown and/or MAC notifications*. Why? Because as long as a MAC address is authorized on a port and is the only one connected, the switch will send no trap whether the device reboots, plugs in or unplugs. This drastically reduces the SNMP interactions between the switches and PacketFence.

When you enable port security traps you should not enable linkUp/linkDown nor MAC notification traps.


=== Technical Introduction to Hybrid Enforcement

==== Introduction

In previous versions of PacketFence, it was not possible to have RADIUS enabled for inline enforcement mode. Now with the new hybrid mode, all the devices that supports 802.1X or MAC-authentication can work with this mode. Let's see how it works.

==== Device Configuration

You need to configure inline enforcement mode in PacketFence and configure your switch(es) / access point(s) to use the VLAN assignment techniques (802.1X or MAC-authentication). You also need to take care of a specific parameter in the switch configuration window, "Trigger to enable inline mode". This parameter is working like a trigger and you have the possibility to define different sort of triggers:

  ALWAYS::
  PORT::
  MAC::
  SSID::

where ALWAYS means that the device is always in inline mode, PORT specify the ifIndex of the port which will use inline enforcement, MAC a mac address that will be put in inline enforcement technique rather than VLAN enforcement and SSID an ssid name.
An example:

  SSID::GuestAccess,MAC::00:11:22:33:44:55

This will trigger all the nodes that connects to the _GuestAccess_ SSID to use inline enforcement mode (PacketFence will return a void VLAN or the `inlineVlan` if defined in switch configuration) and the MAC address `00:11:22:33:44:55` client if it connects on another SSID.

=== Technical Introduction to RADIUS Enforcement

==== Introduction

The concept of having a RADIUS enforcement is to not use registration, isolation, nor the portal capabilities of PacketFence. Everything here is for RADIUS integration only. By default the management interface will be the RADIUS interface. If needed, it is possible to add an other interface from _Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Interface_. When doing so, you must select `Other` as the type of interface. Moreover, you must select `radius` as an additionnal listening daemon.

Using RADIUS enforcement, everytime a device connects to the network, a matching production VLAN will be assigned, depending on the rules in _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Authentication Sources_.

=== Technical Introduction to DNS Enforcement

==== Introduction

DNS enforcement allows you to control the network access of the device by using the `pfdns` service on PacketFence.

The architecture of DNS enforcement is as following :

* DHCP and DNS are provided by the PacketFence server
  - The PacketFence DHCP server will provide the IP of your network equipment as the gateway and the IP address of the PacketFence DNS server to resolve names.
* Routing is provided by another equipment on your network (core switch, firewall, router,...)
* `pfdns` will respond to DNS requests depending on your configuration :
  - user registration on portal : it will return IP address of the captive portal
  - access to another site : it will resolve name externally and use it in reply

This enforcement mode used by itself can be bypassed by the device by using a different DNS server or by using its own DNS cache.

The first can be prevented using an ACL on your routing equipment, the second can be prevented by combining DNS enforcement with Single-Sign-On on your network equipment. Please see the Firewall Single-Sign-On documentation for details on how to accomplish this.

In order to configure DNS enforcement, you first need to go in _Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Networks -> Interface_ then select one of your interfaces and set it in DNS enforcement mode.

After, you need to configure a routed network for this interface by clicking `New routed network`. See the 'Routed Networks' section of this document for details on how to configure it.

NOTE: If you are not using a routed network, you need to use Inline enforcement as DNS enforcement can only be used for routed networks.

Once this is done, you need to restart the `pfdhcp` and `pfdns` services.
