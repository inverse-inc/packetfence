//== Performing Compliance Checks

PacketFence supports either Nessus and OpenVAS as a scanning engine for compliance checks.
Since PacketFence v5.1 you are now able to create multiples scan engines configuration and assign them on specific captive portals.
It mean per example that you are now able to active a scan for specific Operating System only on a specific SSID.

=== Installation

==== Nessus

Please visit https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus to download Nessus v7 and install the Nessus package for your operating system. You will also need to register for the HomeFeed (or the ProfessionalFeed) in order to get the plugins.

After you installed Nessus, follow the Nessus documentation for the configuration of the Nessus Server, and to create a user for PacketFence.

NOTE: You may run into some issue while using Nessus with the Net::Nessus::XMLRPC module (which is the default behavior in PacketFence). Please refer to the http://packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1841[bug tracking system] for more information.

==== OpenVAS

===== Requirements


You will first need to install OpenVAS along with XYZ and ABC in order to manage OpenVAS remotely via the `omp` command line.

In order to validate proper connectivity from PacketFence to OpenVAS for remote management, execute the following command (replacing admin by the user you wish to use for PacketFence to communicate with OpenVAS):

  # omp -u admin -p 9390 -X "<get_version/>" 

The output of the above command should provide you the version of OpenVAS. Otherwise, ensure all the necessary components are in place for management through the `omp` command line client and that PacketFence is able to communicate with OpenVAS on port 9390.

===== Configuring the alert


You will need to configure an alert policy in OpenVAS to inform PacketFence of the completion of a task. The httpd.portal daemon takes care of handling this callback so you'll want to make sure that you have "portal" in your additionnal listening daemons on your management interface in PacketFence.

In order to create the alert policy, go in the Greenbone Security Assistant, then in "Configuration -> Alerts" and create a new alert with the following configuration

image::openvas/alert.png[alt="OpenVAS alert"]

Where:

 * Name is of the value of your choosing
 * Ensure the event is set to "Task run status changed to: Done"
 * Ensure the condition is set to "Always"
 * Method is set to "HTTP Get"
 * HTTP Get URL is set to: http://PF_MANAGEMENT_IP/hook/openvas?task=$n
 ** In the URL above, only change PF_MANAGEMENT_IP to the management IP of your PacketFence server. Leave the rest of the URL untouched as this exact URL and format is expected by PacketFence.

===== Collecting the identifiers

Once you have connectivity working between PacketFence and OpenVAS, use the Greebone Security Assistant to obtain the following information for configuring PacketFence

*Alert ID*

Navigate to _Configuration -> Alerts_, then click on the alert you've configured above to view it, and note down the ID of the alert.

image::openvas/alert-id.png[alt="OpenVAS alert ID"]

*Scan config ID*

Navigate to _Configuration -> Scan Configs_ and then select the scan configuration you would like to use to scan the hosts. In this scan config view, note down the ID.

image::openvas/scan-config-id.png[alt="OpenVAS scan config ID"]

*Report format ID* 

Navigate to _Configuration -> Report Formats_ and then select the `CSV Results` report format. In this view, note down the ID.

image::openvas/report-format-id.png[alt="OpenVAS report format ID"]

=== Configuration

In order for the compliance checks to correctly work with PacketFence (communication and generate security events inside PacketFence), you need to configure these sections:

==== Scanner Definition

First go in Configuration and Scanner Definition: _Configuration -> Compliance -> Scan Engines_

Then add a `New Scan Engine`

image::scan_type.png[alt="Scanner add"]

There are common parameters for each scan engines:

  Name: the name of your scan engine
  Roles: Only devices with these role(s) will be affected (Optional)
  OS: Only devices with this Operating System will be affected (Optional)
  Duration: Approximate duration of scan (Progress bar on the captive portal)
  Scan before registration: Trigger the scan when the device appear on the registration vlan
  Scan on registration: Trigger the scan just after registration on the captive portal
  Scan after registration: Trigger the scan on the production network (pfdhcplistener must receive production dhcp traffic)

Specific to Nessus:

  Hostname or IP Address: Hostname or IP Address where Nessus is running
  Username: Username to connect to Nessus scan
  Password: Password to connect to Nessus scan
  Port of the service: port to connect (default 8834)
  Nessus client policy: the name of the policy to use for the scan (Must be define on the Nessus server)

Specific to OpenVAS:

  Hostname or IP Address: Hostname or IP Address where OpenVAS is running
  Username: Username to connect to OpenVAS scan
  Password: Password to connect to OpenVAS scan
  Port of the service: port to connect (default 9390)
  Alert ID: the ID of the alert configuration on the OpenVAS server
  Scan config ID: the ID of the scanning configuration on the OpenVAS server
  Report format ID: the ID of the report format for the "CSV Results"


===== Rules syntax

The syntax of the rules are simple to understand and use same syntax as <<_vlan_filter_definition,VLAN filters>>.

* _Request_ is the SQL request you will launch on the remote device, you must know what the request will return to write the test.

Inside the _Rules Actions_ field we define 2 sorts of blocs:

* The test bloc (i.e. `[explorer]`)
* The action bloc (i.e. `[1:explorer]`)

The test bloc is a simple test based on the result of the request:

* attribute is the attribute you want to test
* operator can be:
** is
** is_not
** match
** match_not
** advance
* value is the value you want to compare

You can define multiple test blocs.

The action bloc is where you will define your logic. All actions available are
identical to <<_vlan_filter_definition,VLAN filters>>. Take a look at
[filename]`/usr/local/pf/conf/vlan_filters.conf.example` for all available actions.


==== Security Events Definition

You need to create a new security event section and have to specify:

Using Nessus:

  trigger=Nessus::<security event ID>

Using OpenVAS:

  trigger=OpenVAS::<security event ID>

Where `security event ID` is either the ID of the Nessus plugin or the OID of
the OpenVAS plugin to check for. Once you have finished the configuration, you
need to reload the security event related database contents using:

[source,bash]
----
pfcmd reload security_events
----

NOTE: Security events will trigger if the plugin is higher than a low severity vulnerability.

==== Assign Scan definition to connection profiles

The last step is to assign one or more scanner you configured to one or more connection profiles.
Go in _Configuration -> Policies and Access Control -> Connection Profiles -> Edit a Profile -> Add Scan_

===== Hosting Nessus / OpenVAS remotely

Because of the CPU intensive nature of an automated vulnerability assessment, we recommend that it is hosted on a separate server for large environments. To do so, a couple of things are required:

[options="compact"]
* PacketFence needs to be able to communicate to the server on the port specified by the vulnerability engine used
* The scanning server need to be able to access the targets. In other words, registration VLAN access is required if scan on registration is enabled.

If you are using the OpenVAS scanning engine:

[options="compact"]
* The scanning server need to be able to reach PacketFence's Admin interface (on port 1443 by default) by its DNS entry. Otherwise PacketFence won't be notified of completed scans.
* You must have a valid SSL certificate on your PacketFence server

If you are using the Nessus scanning engine:

[options="compact"]
* You just have to change the host value by the Nessus server IP.

=== Rapid7 integration

PacketFence supports integration with Rapid7 to start scans automatically when a device connects to the network and also to receive the Rapid7 alerts via syslog.

==== Rapid7 installation

* Install the InsightVM application 
** https://insightvm.help.rapid7.com/docs/installing-in-linux-environments#section-installing-in-red-hat

* Run the application 
** https://insightvm.help.rapid7.com/docs/running-the-application#section-managing-the-application-in-linux

* Logon to the server: _https://'YourRapid7ServerIP:3780_

NOTE: Make sure that you create a site for the devices you want to manage in Rapid7, you will need to reference it in the PacketFence configuration

==== Configuring the scan engine

===== Rapid7 PacketFence user

First, you will need to create credentials for PacketFence so that it can perform API calls on Rapid7. In order to do so, on Rapid7, go in _Administration -> Users_ and click on `Create`. Then configure the appropriate username and password and make sure the account is enabled.

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

Next, in the roles of that user, select the "Custom" role and assign at least the following privileges to the new user:

[options="compact"]
* Manage Sites
* Manage Scan Enginespfcron
* View Site Asset Data
* Specify Scan Targets
* View Group Asset Data

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

Next, in "Site access" and "Asset group access", ensure you provide access to this user to all the assets and sites it needs to manage. When in doubt, grant access to all sites and asset groups.

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-3.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

image::rapid7/rapid7-user-create-4.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence user"]

===== Configure the scan engine in PacketFence

Once you have the user created, you need to create the scan engine by going in _Configuration -> Compliance -> Scan Engines_ and creating a `New Scan Engine` of the type *Rapid7*

Notes on the configuration:
[options="compact"]
* 172.20.20.230 is the IP address (hostname can also be configured) of your Rapid7 server
* Verify Hostname must be disabled unless you have a valid SSL certificate configured for the configured Rapid7 hostname
* Roles and OS represents the roles and operating systems for which you want to apply this scan engine. Leaving them empty will apply the policy to all devices.
* Scan before/on/after registration controls when the automated scans are started for the devices PacketFence sees. If you only want to start the scans manually, leave those unchecked.
* You will not be able to select a scan template, site and scan engine when initially configuring the engine. First configure the access and credentials and edit the engine again to be able to select those from the available values in Rapid7.

image::rapid7/rapid7-pf.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 PacketFence config"]

===== Assign the engine to a connection profile

With the scan engine now created, you need to assign it to the connection profile that your endpoints use. In order to do so, go in _Configuration -> Connection Profiles_, select your connection profile and add your scan engine there.

image::rapid7/rapid7-connection-profile.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 connection profile"]

===== Viewing data on endpoints

With the scan engine integration completed, PacketFence will now automatically start scans on the endpoints it sees DHCP for and you will be able to view the Rapid7 information of the endpoints by going in the _Nodes_ tab in PacketFence and then viewing a node and browsing its Rapid7 tab.

image::rapid7/rapid7-node-tab.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 node tab"]

==== Configuring the syslog integration

PacketFence also supports integration with the syslog forwarding of Rapid7 (with or without the scan engine integration) in order to receive vulnerability alerts from Rapid7.

===== Sending syslog information to PacketFence

In Rapid7:
[options="compact"]
* First select the site you want to have alerts for and click on __Manage Site__
* In the site management tabs select *Alerts*, then create a new alert

[options="compact"]
*Enable*: Must be checked. 
*Alert Name*: Rsyslog to PacketFence or else.
*Maximum Alerts to send*: blank (none)
*Scan events*: Check all.
*Vulnerability Events*: _Any severity_ ; Check as well _Confirmed_, _Unconfirmed_, _Potential_
*Notification Method*: Select _Syslog message_
*Syslog Server*: PacketFence cluster VIP or server IP for a standalone

image::rapid7/rapid7-syslog.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 syslog"]

===== Creating the alert pipe on PacketFence

WARNING: If you are using a PacketFence cluster, you will need to do these steps on all your PacketFence servers.

First, logon to PacketFence Server with a ssh terminal, then create the fifo pipe file that PacketFence will use to get data from Rapid7.

  mkfifo /usr/local/pf/var/run/nexpose_pipe

Create a new file named /etc/rsyslog.d/nexpose-log.conf with the following content

 # rsyslog conf for Rapid7 Nexpose server logs reception
 if $programname == 'Nexpose' then /usr/local/pf/var/run/nexpose_pipe
 & ~

Next, modify /etc/rsyslog.conf to accept syslogs data on 'udp 514' by uncommenting the following two lines:

 $ModLoad imudp
 $UDPServerRun 514

Restart the 'rsyslog' service

  service rsyslog restart

At this point PacketFence must be able to get the Rapid7 audit results via syslog.

TIP: You can see if the Nexpose server is sending to the right server by monitoring the traffic using `tcpdump -i any dst host YOUR_PACKETFENCE_SERVER_IP` on your Rapid7 Nexpose server and `tcpdump -i any src host YOUR_RAPID7_IP` on the PacketFence server.

===== Creating the event handler

In the Packetfence administration interface, go to _Configuration -> Integration -> Event Handlers_ and add a new Nexpose event handler

image::rapid7/rapid7-syslog-parser.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Rapid7 event handler"]

[options="compact"]
* As Detector, put the name of your choice for this parser.
* In Alert pipe, put the 'absolute' path to our nexpose pipe ([filename]`/usr/local/pf/var/run/nexpose_pipe` if you used the same name as above)

Once done, restart the following services

  /usr/local/pf/pfcmd service pfdetect restart
  /usr/local/pf/pfcmd service pfqueue restart

Now that PacketFence is properly configured to receive information from Nexpose, we can configure it to perform some actions on the alerts it receives. In the PacketFence GUI, go to _Configuration -> Compliance -> Security Events_ and create a new security event.

Make sure you set the following parameters in the 'Definition' tab:
[options="compact"]
* Enable: Set it to *ON* 
* Action: This is where you put what you want PacketFence to do, refer to the security events documentation in this guide for details on these.

Next, in the 'Triggers' tab:
[options="compact"]
* Click on the plus *(+)*, on the right side of the page.
* On the second line, choose the appropriate trigger between "*nexpose_event_contains*" or "*nexpose_event_start_with*"
* Choose "nexpose_event_contains" if you know, for example, the "*Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*" you want to take action on.
* For "*nexpose_event_contains*": You can put there the CVE or the vlnerability name you are looking for.
* For "*nexpose_event_start_with*": Put there the full vulnerability name you can find in the Nexpose report, on the Nexpose GUI
* Click on *ADD*, then *SAVE*
