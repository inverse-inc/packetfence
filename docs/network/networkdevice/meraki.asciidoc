//=== Meraki

To add the AP on PacketFence use the internal IP of the AP.

The 'Disconnect port' field must be set to '1700'.

==== WebAuth

In this section, we will cover the configuration of the Meraki controller to use Web authentication.

NOTE: While using the WebAuth mode on the Meraki controller, you need to use "Role mapping by Switch Role" and "Role by Web Auth URL" in the tab 'Roles' from the switch configuration.

Configure your SSID as shown below:

image::Meraki-V2-2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Network configuration"]

NOTE: It is mandatory that you use the Airespace-ACL-Name as "RADIUS attribute specifying group policy name".

The switch module to use for this configuration is "Meraki cloud controller V2".

Next, configure the roles for the devices on your network. Go in 'Network-wide->Group policies', then you will be able to create policies that can be configured as roles in the switch configuration of PacketFence. Creation of the policy `Guest`:

Your configuration for the tab "Roles" in PacketFence will look like the following:

image::meraki-config-pf-role.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="PacketFence role configuration"]

image::meraki-config-pf-url.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="PacketFence URL configuration"]

URL in registration field should be in the form: 'http://<your_captive_portal_ip>/Meraki::MR_v2'

==== VLAN enforcement

This section will cover how to configure the Meraki WiFI controller to use with VLAN enforcement, use the configuration in the section `WebAuth` for the SSID.

In the configuration of PacketFence, use "Role by VLAN ID" and fill your VLANs matching roles.

==== Dynamic PSK (Pre-Shared Key)

This section will cover how to configure the Meraki WiFI controller to use with Dynamic PSK with PacketFence.

You will be able to attribute one PSK per user to use on every device they want. There is a common key to connect to a given PSK secured SSID to register and you will have an option to provision your device with that configuration on Windows, Apple and Android devices.

Create the SSID

Provioner configuration

Go to Configuration > Advanced Access Configuration > Provisioner > New provisioner > DPSK

Connection profile configuration

Go to Configuration > Policies and Access Control > Connection Profiles > New Connection Profile

===== MS Switch Modules

MS Modules
This is a standard switch module designed to support all the legacy Meraki Switch series using MS version earlier than v15.x.

Meraki MSv15 
MSv15 module is designed for the switch series operating on MS_OS v15. Furthermore, it inherits all functionalities from the old "MS220_8" module, making all the configurations below applicable to MSv15.

NOTE: You should already have one port setup as Uplink, using a mode trunk, with at least your Registration and Production VLAN allowed on it.

The Meraki switch offer configuration for VLAN enforcement only.

You will need to access the Meraki dashboard to configure your switch. When you reach it you will need first to create a policy. You can create a "MAC authentication bypass" or a "802.1X" policy. Depending if you want to authenticate user via dot1x or MAB. You cannot combine both neither use a fallback mode on the same port, each port with a policy applied will be exclusive to MAB or dot1x.

To access the policy creation go to 'Switching->Access Policies' in the Meraki dashboard menu. From there create a new policy, use the example below to create your policy.

image::Meraki-switch-policies.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Access policies"]

You now need to apply one of your policies to ports. To do so, go to 'Switch->Switch ports' and chose your options. To add a policy you created earlier, select it in the drop down list in `Access policy`. You need to configure the port in "mode access", the default access VLAN is not important if your VLANs are properly configured on PacketFence.

===== RADSEC

It is possible to use RADSEC between Meraki and PacketFence in order to perform RADIUS over TCP and encrypted using TLS. Before performing the steps outlined in this section, make sure you have a working SSID using normal unencrypted RADIUS by following the steps in the sections above

Then, in order to enable RADSEC, go in your SSID configuration and under 'RADIUS proxy', select 'Use Meraki proxy' and save the settings.

After saving, check the RADSEC checkbox and save your settings.

Now, on your PacketFence server, you must add the Meraki CA root to the trusted Certificate Authorities of FreeRADIUS when performing RADSEC. You should download the Meraki CA certificate from your Meraki dashboard under Organization->Configure->Certificates and selecting "Download CA" below RadSec AP Certificates. You can then append the content of this certificate to /usr/local/pf/raddb/certs/ca.pem on your PacketFence server.

Next, restart radiusd to reload the CA certificates using:

  # /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service radiusd restart

NOTE: RADSEC is done over port 2083 so make sure your server is available via a public IP address for this port and allows connections from your Meraki cloud controller. Refer to the Meraki documentation for details.
