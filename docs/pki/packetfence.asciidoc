This section has been created to give a quick start to install the PacketFence PKI in PacketFence. This guide does not include advanced troubleshooting of EAP-TLS connections. Refer to the relevant documentation of EAP-TLS, RADIUS and OpenSSL for advanced features.

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^

* You have at least one server with PacketFence 5.2 or later.
* The server already has a properly configured switch with 802.1X support.
* The PacketFence RADIUS server is working in your environment.
* A Mail Transport Agent is properly configured on the PacketFence server.
* The PacketFence management IP will be 192.168.1.5.
* The RADIUS shared secret is "useStrongerSecret".

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the PKI
+++++++++++++++

NOTE: The PacketFence PKI application is available on the PacketFence repository as the package "packetfence-pki". This is available for CentOS 6, CentOS 7 and Debian 7 and Debian 8.

PacketFence PKI can be installed on a standalone machine or on the PacketFence server itself.
Communication between the PKI and PacketFence proper will take place over a REST API over port 9393.

Preparing to install in standalone mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

** Open the ports 9393 and 9292 over TCP to be able to reach the PKI. This has to be done in the firewall (iptables).

** Disable SELinux:

 vim /etc/selinux/config

** Change the line:

 SELINUX=enforcing

to:

 SELINUX=disabled

** Reboot for the change to take effect.


Preparing to install with PacketFence 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Allow TCP traffic over ports 9393 and 9292 through iptables:

 vim /usr/local/pf/conf/iptables.conf
 
Uncomment the following lines. 

 # -A input-management-if --protocol tcp --match tcp --dport 9393 --jump ACCEPT
 # -A input-management-if --protocol tcp --match tcp --dport 9292 --jump ACCEPT

Restart the iptables service:

 bin/pfcmd service iptables restart
 
Installation
++++++++++++

*Debian*

In order to use the repository, create a file named `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/packetfence.list`:

 echo 'deb http://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/debian wheezy wheezy' > \
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/packetfence.list

Once the repository is defined, you can install packetfence-pki using:

 sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net \
 --recv-key 0xFE9E84327B18FF82B0378B6719CDA6A9810273C4
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install packetfence-pki

*CentOS/RHEL*

Installing on RHEL or CentOS requires the packetfence and packetfence-extra repositories.
Install them first and then install the packetfence-pki package itself.

 yum localinstall http://inverse.ca/downloads/PacketFence/CentOS6/x86_64/RPMS/packetfence-release-1-2.centos6.noarch.rpm
 yum install packetfence-pki --enablerepo=packetfence-extra, packetfence


Configuring the PKI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence-PKI Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE: The following configuration will allow you to generate certificates for an EAP-TLS configuration, if you want to use the PKI for another purpose you will have to adjust the Key Usage/Extended Key Usage fields.


1. Ensure that the service has started:

 service packetfence-pki start

2. Log on to the PKI application:

* URL: https://192.168.1.5:9393
* Login: admin
* Default Password: p@ck3tf3nc3

After you login there are few steps to follow to have the PKI working for an EAP-TLS configuration with PacketFence.
You will need to configure the following items: 

* A Certification Authority (CA)
* Profiles for each purpose, e.g. server/client auth are 2 different profiles
* The REST API authentication and authorization
* A RADIUS server certificate
* A PKI Provider (optional)
* A Provisioner (optional)

Follow the four step wizard to create your certification authority, your client and server profile and your REST API configuration.

Certification Authority
+++++++++++++++++++++++

image::packetfence-pki-myca.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Certification authority"]

image::packetfence-pki-myca2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Certification authority"]

Fill out the following fields that will be used to generate the certification authority.

* CN: Subject of the certification authority
* Mail: Email address of the admin or any other mail that suit your situation
* OU: Organization Unit
* Organization: Name of your company
* Country: Country (select in the list)
* State: state code (i.e. NY, CA, QC, etc...)
* Locality: City where is the organization 
* Key type, size and digest: we recommend to use the following RSA, 2048, sha1
* Key Usage and Extended Key Usage are not necessary for the certification authority
* Days: Number of validity days, i.e. 10y = 3650

CAUTION: Remember that after the expiration date of your certification authority, every certificate generated by it will be invalidated. We recommend at least 10 years for the CA.

Server authentication Profile
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This profile will be used to generate the RADIUS server certificate and key.
The server certificate is used by the RADIUS server to authenticate its end of the connection to the client.

Fill out the following fields that will be used to generate the certificate profile to use for generating server certificates.

* Name: A name by which to identify this profile
* Validity: Number of validity days, i.e. 2y = 730
* Key type, size and digest: we recommend using the following: RSA, 2048, sha256
* Key Usage: Optional 
* Extended Key Usage: "serverAuth"

* The P12 mail setup is mandatory for the server and client authentication profile. This is required to send the certificate and password by email using the *send certificate* button. 
** If your mail alerts are already working with PacketFence you should use the following:
*** P12 smtp server: 127.0.0.1
*** Tick P12 mail password

The following fields should be configured according to your preferences and will fill out the email sent when exporting the certificate:

* P12 mail subject:  A descriptive line indicating that this is the certificate required to authenticate
* P12 mail from: The email address of the CA manager
* P12 mail header: Text that will appear in all emails sent with the certificate
* P12 mail footer: Optional, e.g. "This email has been generated automatically, please do not reply."

image::packetfence-pki-server-profile.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="RADIUS server certificate"]

CAUTION: We recommend using a long validity for your RADIUS server certificate to avoid it expiring too frequently (i.e. two to five years).

Client Authentication Profile
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This profile will be used to generate the RADIUS client certificate and key.
The client certificate is used by the 802.1X supplicant to authenticate its end of the connection to the server.

image::packetfence-pki-client-profile.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Client Profile configuration"]


REST API Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++

image::packetfence-pki-rest-api.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="REST API configuration"]

The fields shown above are required to allow use of the REST API over which PacketFence and the PKI exchange authentication information.
A username and password are mandatory.


Common tasks in PacketFence-PKI interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change PKI default password
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CAUTION: Please be sure to change the default password to the PKI.

To change PKI default password, you will need to change `admin` user
password. Password can be changed in 'Configuration -> Users' after editing a
user.


User Creation
+++++++++++++

Additional users for specific tasks may be created under 'Configuration -> Users' .

All fields are mandatory. Users can be associated with the REST API configuration.


Creating RADIUS server certificate
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CAUTION: After the creation of your certificate you need to sign it.

. Click on 'Add Certificate' button in 'Certificate -> Certificates' menu
. Fill out form fields:
.. Mail: mail address that will receive certificate file and password
.. Profile: your server profile defined above
. Click on 'Submit' button
. Click on 'Sign' button to sign your server certificate
. Click on :
.. 'Send certificate' to send certificate by mail with password
.. 'Download certificate' to download certificate and receive certificate's password by mail


Manage certificates profiles
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can manage certificates profiles under 'Certificate -> Profiles'.


Configuring PacketFence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certificate storage on PacketFence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
It is recommended to create a separate directory to separate EAP-TLS certificates from server certificates:

 mkdir /usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/tls_certs/

RADIUS EAP-TLS authentication requires three files: the CA certificate, the server certificate and the private key.

The CA certificate generated by the PacketFence PKI will be placed in `/usr/local/packetfence-pki/ca/`.
Copy the CA certificate (and not it's private key) to the directory created above and make sure it is readable by the "pf" user.

In the case where the PKI was installed on the same server as PacketFence, this will mean for example:
  
 cp /usr/local/packetfence-pki/ca/YourCA.pem /usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/tls_certs/
 chown pf:pf /usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/tls_certs/*

Since the server certificate is stored in the PKI database, you will have to sign and export it to the PacketFence server.

On the PKI web interface, under Certificates click on the "sign" icon for the certificate for your RADIUS server. 
This will automatically sign the certificate with your CA. 
Use the 'Send certificate' or 'Download certificate' to export it. 
The certificate will be exported in p12 format which combines both the certificate and its key. 
The password to decrypt the file will be send by email.

Copy the p12 formatted file to the `tls_certs` directory on the PacketFence server:
 
 scp /path/to/your/downloads/YourCert.* root@192.168.1.5:/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/tls_certs/

Then, convert the p12 file to the pem format using the `openssl` tool:

 cd /usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/tls_certs/
 openssl pkcs12 -in YourCert.p12 -nocerts -out YourCert.key -nodes
 openssl pkcs12 -in YourCert.p12 -out YourCert.pem -clcerts -nokeys

Ensure that the files are readable by `pf`:

 chown pf:pf /usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/tls_certs/*
 
RADIUS EAP-TLS and packetfence-pki
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the PKI generated certificates requires editing the RADIUS EAP configuration file.

Edit the `/usr/local/pf/conf/radiusd/eap.conf` file and replace the following lines with references to your new certificates in the 'tls-common' configuration block:

 private_key_file = [% install_dir %]/raddb/certs/server.key
 certificate_file = [% install_dir %]/raddb/certs/server.crt
 ca_file = [% install_dir %]/raddb/certs/ca.pem

E.g.

 private_key_file = [% install_dir %]/conf/ssl/tls_certs/YourCert.key
 certificate_file = [% install_dir %]/conf/ssl/tls_certs/YourCert.pem
 ca_file = [% install_dir %]/conf/ssl/tls_certs/YourCA.pem


Certificate revocation checks also have to be configured using OCSP in the same block.

For example: 

    ocsp {
        enable = yes
        override_cert_url = yes
        url = "http://192.168.1.5:9292/pki/ocsp/"
    }


Regenerate the new configuration files and restart `radiusd` to enable EAP-TLS using your CA signed certificates:

 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service radiusd generateconfig
 /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service radiusd restart

PacketFence provider configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the PKI requires configuring the PKI providers section in the PacketFence's web admin interface under 'Configuration -> Advanced Access Configuration -> Users'.
The provider configuration defines how PacketFence connects to the PKI REST API and which profile will be used.

Add a new PKI provider and select PacketFence PKI.

Fill out the form for a PKI provider according to the PKI configuration profile you created earlier.
Pay attention to the username and password which have to match an authorized user in the PKI configuration.

image::packetfence-pki-provider.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="PacketFence PKI configuration"]

image::packetfence-pki-provider2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="PacketFence PKI configuration"]

The "CA cert path" and "Server cert path" fields both need to be absolute (e.g. `/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/tls_certs/MyCA.pem` is an absolute path).

The "Common name attribute" field defines how the certificate will be generated and what type of "ownership" will associate the certificate to the connection.
If you select 'MAC address', a certificate will be generated for the device itself using the MAC address as the identifier.
If you select 'Username', a certificate will be generated for the user using his login name on the authentication backend (e.g. Active Directory).

IMPORTANT: This means that revoking the certificate for a username based certificate will block all the devices that this user registered.
If you generate the certificates using the MAC address, revoking a certificate will block only that device.

Provisioners configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Provisioners allow devices to automatically configure themselves to connect to the proper SSID (if applicable), use the proper authentication method (e.g. EAP-TLS) and trust the CA certificate and any certificate signed by it.

Provisioners are configured in the PacketFence's web admin interface under 'Configuration -> Users -> Provisioners', see <<provision,Integrating Provisioning Agents>> section.

Revocation process
++++++++++++++++++

Certificates can be checked for revocation at authentication time using either OCSP to interrogate the PKI for every RADIUS authentication or using the certificate revocation lists (CRL). 

OCSP is scalable, its main downside would be that one request per certificate authentication is sent to the PKI to verify if the certificate is still valid and that adds additional latency to authentication. Additionally, RADIUS authentication then becomes dependent on an external service which could be unreachable although that can be mitigated in the FreeRADIUS configuration.

Using a CRL implies that each time the CRL is updated, every services that uses this CRL has to download it again. For security reason we recommend a short delay on CRL expiration (to avoid using revoked certificate on the network).

By default a CRL list will be created when you revoke a certificate. The file will be under `/usr/local/packetfence-pki/ca/YourProfileName.crl`. Note that one CRL by profile will be created.
