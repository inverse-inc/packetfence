General Upgrade Tips
--------------------

Database backup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before making any changes to your database, ensure that you have a backup.
A complete database backup can be taken using this command:

  mysqldump --opt --routines -u root -p pf | gzip > /root/packetfence_db.sql.gz

If your database is more than a few hundred megabytes, you may also want to consider using a tool such as Percona XtraBackup which makes for much faster restores than mysqldump.

It is also possible to simply backup the actual MySQL files themselves -- as long as the database is not currently running.
To do so, stop MySQL and then copy all files under /var/lib/mysql to a secure directory.

PacketFence configurations and codebase backup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Taking a complete backup of your current installation is strongly recommended.
You can take a backup of the pf directory with the following command:

  tar -C /usr/local -czf /root/packetfence.tar.gz pf --exclude='pf/logs' --exclude='pf/var'

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

NOTE: These are general upgrade instructions. Make sure to go through (read) the upgrade instructions specific to the upgrade path taken since some steps may be required to be done *BEFORE* the packages upgrades.

### For a clustered environment

Please refer to the https://github.com/inverse-inc/packetfence/blob/stable/docs/PacketFence_Clustering_Guide.asciidoc[PacketFence Clustering Guide], more specifically the https://github.com/inverse-inc/packetfence/blob/stable/docs/PacketFence_Clustering_Guide.asciidoc#performing-an-upgrade-on-a-cluster[Perform an upgrade on a cluster] section.

### For a standalone server

It is recommended that you stop the currently running PacketFence services before proceeding any further.
To do so, run the following commands:

  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pf stop
  service packetfence-config stop

RHEL / CentOS based systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following command to update PacketFence:

  yum update packetfence --enablerepo=packetfence
  
Since PacketFence heavily relies on Fingerbank, it is recommended to make sure you are running the latest version:

  yum update fingerbank --enablerepo=packetfence

PacketFence and Fingerbank should now be upgraded. However, there may be extra steps required depending on the version you are upgrading from. Please review the following notes about upgrading from an older release.

NOTE: Upgrade notes for a given upgrade path are cumulative. That is to say, if you are upgrading from version 5.3 to version 6.0 you must apply in order all changes in between the two versions, including database schema changes.

Debian based systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  apt update

Run the following command to update PacketFence:

  apt install packetfence

Since PacketFence heavily relies on Fingerbank, it is recommended to make sure you are running the latest version:

  apt install fingerbank

PacketFence and Fingerbank should now be upgraded. However, there may be extra steps required depending on the version you are upgrading from. Please review the following notes about upgrading from an older release.

NOTE: Upgrade notes for a given upgrade path are cumulative. That is to say, if you are upgrading from version 5.3 to version 6.0 you must apply in order all changes in between the two versions, including database schema changes.

'''

You should take care to review any changes to configuration files and merge them if required. 
To find out which configuration files have changed run this command:


RHEL / CentOS based systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  find /usr/local/pf -name \*.rpmnew

The list of files returned are the new versions shipped with PacketFence.
Compare them to your existing version and see if there are changes that should be merged into your existing configuration.
Then, once you are done make sure to delete these files so that there is no confusion the next time you upgrade PacketFence.

Debian based systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Debian installation system should have interactively asked for existing modified files.

'''

Once the additionnal steps below are completed, restart packetfence-config and packetfence

  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd fixpermissions
  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd pfconfig clear_backend
  service packetfence-config restart
  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service pf restart

Don't forget to edit the `/usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at` file to match the newly updated version

  cat /usr/local/pf/conf/pf-release > /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at


Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.0
---------------------------------------

Upgrading an old version of PacketFence to v4 will be quite
an endeavor. While it's entirely possible if done meticulously, we
suggest you start from scratch and move your customizations and
nodes information over to your new installation.

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The temporary password table has been extended to include roles information.
Moreover, an "admin" user is now automatically created. The default password
is also "admin". Finally, a new table has been added for saved searches in the
new Web administrative interface.

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-3.6.1-4.0.0.sql

Other important changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence v4 received a major overhaul, especially regarding the authentication
sources. Authentication modules found in `conf/authentication/` are no longer
being used and have been replaced by the `conf/authentication.conf` file. While
this file can be hand-edited, you should create your authentication sources
and perform roles-mapping using the Configuation > Users > Sources page from
PacketFence's Web administrative interface.

Also, in PacketFence v4, the VLANs can be assigned in `conf/switches.conf` by constructing
the parameter names from the VLAN names and the `Vlan` suffix. The VLAN names must match one
of the default names (registration, isolation, macDetection, inline, and voice) or one of the
defined roles. If you were using custom VLANs, you must create a new role per VLAN and assign
them accordingly.

Other key changes were done, such as:

* moved remediation templates in `html/captive-portal/templates/violations` and converted them to Template Toolkit
* dropped guests_admin_registration.category
* dropped guests_self_registration.access_duration
* dropped guests_self_registration.category
* dropped guests_self_registration.sponsor_authentication
* dropped guests_self_registration.sponsors_only_from_localdomain
* dropped ports.listeners
* dropped registration.auth and registration.default_auth
* dropped registration.maxnodes
* dropped registration.expire_* and registration.skip_*
* dropped trapping.blacklist
* dropped support for resetVlanAllPort in `bin/pfcmd_vlan`
* dropped `sbin/pfredirect` binary
* splitted the httpd services in three: httpd.admin, httpd.portal and httpd.webservices
* domain-name is no longer required in each section of networks.conf

For all parameters related to authentication (categories, access duration, sponsor authentication, etc.),
you should now set proper actions in the `conf/authentication.conf` file.

Finally, the `pf` must be sudoer access to the `/sbin/ip` (and others) binary. As root, please do:

  echo "pf ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables, /usr/sbin/ipset, /sbin/ip, /sbin/vconfig, /sbin/route, /sbin/service, /usr/bin/tee, /usr/local/pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener, /bin/kill, /usr/sbin/dhcpd, /usr/sbin/radiusd" >> /etc/sudoers




Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.1
---------------------------------------

This release only fixes various bugs and doesn't need the database schema to be
modified. Simply update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new
release number.
Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.2
---------------------------------------

This release only fixes various bugs and doesn't need the database schema to be
modified. Simply update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new
release number.

LDAP SSL and STARTTLS is now correctly implemented.
Make sure the server you specify in authentication.conf supports the encryption type 
requested on the port configured. Failure to do so will break LDAP and Active Directory 
authentication.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.3
---------------------------------------

You need to downgrade the version of perl-Net-DNS and perl-Net-DNS-Nameserver to
version 0.65-4 in order to fix the issue with pfdns crashing.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.4
---------------------------------------

The parameter guest_self_reg in the profiles.conf file is no longer necessary.
The self-registration is now automatically enabled if at least one external 
authentication source is selected (Email, SMS, SponsorEmail, or Oauth2).

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.5
---------------------------------------

This release adds a new dependency on the Perl module Apache::SSLLookup. Once installed, 
update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.6
---------------------------------------

Changes to authentication API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method pf::authentication::authenticate now expects an array of pf::authentication::Source objects
instead of an array of source IDs.

The methods getSourceByType, getInternalSources, and getExternalSources of the module pf::Portal::Profile
now return pf::authentication::Source objects instead of source IDs.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.1.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The category column in the temporary_password should not be mandatory.

Also, the access_level of the temporary_password table is now a string instead of a bit string.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-4.0.0-4.1.0.sql

Configuration changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameters `trapping.redirecturl` and `trapping.always_use_redirecturl` from `pf.conf` (or `pf.conf.defaults`)
were moved to the default portal profile in `profiles.conf`.

The parameter `registration.range` has been deprecated. Make sure you remove it from your configuration file.

The action `set_access_level` of authentication sources in `authentication.conf` must now match one of the admin roles
defined in `adminroles.conf`. The previous level `4294967295` must be replaced by *ALL* and the level `0` by *NONE*.

Adjust your configuration files accordingly.

Once the configuration completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.2.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The person table has many new columns that can be used for registration.

Configuration changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameter `guests_self_registration.mandatory_fields` from `pf.conf` (or `pf.conf.defaults`) was moved to the
default portal profile in `profiles.conf`.

The parameters `registration.gaming_devices_registration` and `registration.gaming_devices_registration_role` are replaced
with `registration.device_registration` and `registration.device_registration_role`.

Adjust your configuration files accordingly.

The captive portal has been rewritten using the Catalyst MVC framework. Any customization to the previous CGI scripts
will need to be ported to the new architecture.

Once the configuration completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.3.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-4.3.0-4.4.0.sql

Cache serialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The serialization of the objects in the cache changed, making all the previous cached objects invalid.
With PacketFence completely stopped do :

  rm -fr /usr/local/pf/var/cache/*

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 4.4.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.5.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The class table has a new column delay_by.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-4.4.0-4.5.0.sql

Violation configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new parameter 'delay_by' has been introduced in the violation configuration. Make sure to add the following to the 'defaults' section of 'conf/violations.conf' to avoid any problem.

delay_by=0s

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 4.5.0).

Violation template pages language handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code to match violation template pages have been reworked. Make sure to lowercase FR to fr in french template files name.

Realm configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Realm are now managed by Freeradius server so if your users authenticate with a username like username@acme.com then add the realm acme.com
in the Radius Realms configuration menu and in your Active Directory source select 'Use stripped username'.

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 4.6.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.7.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 'node' table has a new column (machine_account).

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-4.6.0-4.7.0.sql

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 4.7.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 5.0.0
---------------------------------------

Upgrading a version of PacketFence older than 4.1 to v5 will be a complex undertaking.
While it's entirely possible if done meticulously, we
suggest you start from scratch and move your customizations and
nodes information over to your new installation.

Please note that the sections below are cumulative. That is to say, if you are upgrading from version 4.3 to version 5.0 you must apply in order all changes in between the two versions, including database schema changes.

As always, taking a complete backup of your current installation is strongly recommended. 
A backup should contain a copy of all PacketFence files as well as a copy of the database.
You can take a backup of the pf directory with the following command:

  tar -C /usr/local -czf /root/packetfence.tar.gz pf 

A backup of the database can be taken using the procedure described in the next section.

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before making any changes to your database, ensure that you have a backup.
A complete database backup can be taken using this command:

  mysqldump --opt --routines -u root -p pf | gzip > /root/packetfence_db.sql.gz

If your database is more than a few hundred megabytes, you may also want to consider using a tool such as Percona XtraBackup which makes for much faster restores than mysqldump.


Multiple changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
Since we will be dropping and recreating the 'iplog' table it is essential that you have a backup if you need the data it contains.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-4.7.0-5.0.0.sql

Configuration changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must manually enter the MySQL password of the pf user in the conf/pfconfig.conf file.
The MySQL password is saved in the conf/pf.conf file under the [database] section.
Copy the following from conf/pf.conf to conf/pfconfig.conf: 

  pass=$YOURPASSWORDHERE
  

Violations configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The violation triggers have been reworked for the new Fingerbank integration.
We highly suggest you copy `conf/violations.conf.example` over `conf/violations.conf` and then reconfigure any violations you had before.

Also, make sure you adjust the following triggers to their new ID (Can be found under 'Configuration->Fingerbank'):

* `USERAGENT` becomes `user_agent`
* `VENDORMAC` becomes `mac_vendor`

The `OS` trigger has been deprecated over the new `dhcp_fingerprint` trigger. 
You will need to adjust these triggers to the new ids as well as renaming them.

iptables changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The iptables configuration file doesn't use the generated rules '%%input_mgmt_guest_rules%%' anymore. 
Make sure you remove this line from conf/iptables.conf.

Also a lot of additions were made to the iptables configuration file. 
Make sure you add the new rules in conf/iptables.conf.example to your existing iptables file or execute the following command to replace the whole file.

  cp /usr/local/pf/conf/iptables.conf.example /usr/local/pf/conf/iptables.conf

Using EAP local authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using EAP MS-CHAP local authentication, meaning your 802.1x connections authenticate against your local database, you will need to make sure you deactivate password encryption in the database.
In the administration interface, go in 'Configuration -> Advanced' and set 'Database passwords hashing method' to `plaintext`

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.0.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 5.1.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.0.0-5.1.0.sql

pfsetvlan and snmptrapd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These two services have been disabled by default. 
If you are using SNMP traps enforcement on your switches (like port-security), make sure you re-enable them in 'Configuration->Services'.

Active Directory domain join
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Microsoft Active Directory domain join configuration is now part of PacketFence. 
A migration script has been made so you can migrate an existing domain join into this configuration.
Note that this step is not mandatory, as the old join method is still supported. But if you do
not perform this step, you will not see its configuration from the PacketFence web administrative interface.

Simply execute the following script and follow its instructions `/usr/local/pf/addons/AD/migrate.pl`

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.1.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 5.2.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.1.0-5.2.0.sql

Database monitoring host
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using an Active/Active cluster, you will need to adjust the monitoring database host to point to your database as it is not forced anymore.

In `conf/pf.conf` :

----
[monitoring]
db_host=127.0.0.1
----

New 'portal' interface type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using email registration, web-auth enforcement (external captive-portal), device registration feature, or anything that would require to access the captive portal from outside the registration/isolation VLANs, you might want (actually, you need otherwise it will no longer works!) to add the 'portal' type to the existing 'management' interface.

In `conf/pf.conf` :

----
[interface eth42]
type=management,portal
----


Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.2.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 5.3.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.2.0-5.3.0.sql

Debian and Ubuntu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A downgrade in a package version may cause an error when trying to upgrade.

If you receive this error: 

  The following packages have unmet dependencies:
   packetfence : Depends: libhtml-formhandler-perl (= 0.40013-2) but 0.40050-2 is to be installed
  E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Run the following commands:

  # dpkg -r --ignore-depends=packetfence   libhtml-formhandler-perl
  # apt-get install  libhtml-formhandler-perl  libtemplate-autofilter-perl  libmoo-perl 
  # apt-get install packetfence packetfence-config packetfence-pfcmd-suid libdist-checkconflicts-perl libimport-into-perl 

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.3.0).


Upgrading from a version prior to 5.4.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.3.0-5.4.0.sql

Authentication sources rules rework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authentication sources rules have been reworked in a way to differentiate an 'authentication' rule and an 'administration' rule. Codewise, that means that codeflow will look into specific types of rules depending of the use case.

Please take a minute or two to go through the existing rules for each of the authentication sources and make sure there is no 'administration' class actions into an 'authentication' class rule and vice versa, otherwise the "invalid" action will be ignored.

Authentication sources rules structure is as follow:

* 'authentication' rule class available actions:
** Set role (set_role)
** Set access duration (set_access_duration)
** Set unregistration date (set_unreg_date)
* 'administration' rule class available actions:
** Set access level of Web admin (set_access_level)
** Mark as sponsor (mark_as_sponsor)

For example, if an existing rule is as follow:

* Name: AllAdmins
* Class: No class defined since the class attribute is new
* Conditions: ...
* Actions:
** Set access level of Web admin -> ALL
** Set role -> default
** Set access duration -> 24H

That existing rule will default to the 'authentication' class if none is being set. 
If that's the case, the first action "Set access level of Web admin" will then be ignored.

To replicate that existing rule with the new classes, you would have to create two separate rules, as follow:

Rule for 'administration' purposes

* Name: AllAdmins_admin 
* Class: administration
* Conditions: ...
* Actions:
** Set access level of Web admin -> ALL

Rule for 'authentication' purposes

* Name: AllAdmins_auth
* Class: authentication
* Conditions: ...
* Actions:
** Set role -> default
** Set access duration -> 24H

Configuration will be validated on every start / restart so that "bogus" authentication sources / rules can be identified.


OAuth2 authentication sources changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Facebook API now requires to specify the fields to be defined in the query.
In all your facebook sources, change the parameter protected_resource_url to https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=id,name,email,first_name,last_name

Change the parameter scope to user,user:email in all your Github sources as PacketFence is now fetching the email address of the user when registering with Github.

StatsD configuration changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

monitoring.statsd_host and monitoring.statsd_port have been removed from pf.conf. 
If you have specified a specific host or port, remove them from your configuration and change them in /usr/local/pf/lib/pf/StatsD.pm

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.4.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 5.5.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.4.0-5.5.0.sql

VLAN Filter configuration changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VLAN filter has been reworked to use a more generalized syntax to allow more complex filters to be created.

This mean nested conditions no longer need to specify the attribute in the condition.

So the following attribute

   [condition]
   filter=node_info
   attribute=category
   operator=is
   value=default

Should be rewritten as

   [condition]
   filter=node_info.category
   operator=is
   value=default

The older syntax is still supported but will be deprecated in a future release.

The operators match and match_not has changed their behavior.
They will match (or not match) the exact string given in the condition.
The following condition

  [condition]
  filter=node_info.computername
  operator=match
  value=^Bob

Will match node_info.computername only if it contians '^Bob'.
It will not match if node_info.computername start with 'Bob'

If you need to use a regex then use the regex/regex_not operator.
So the following condition should be changed from

  [condition]
  filter=node_info.mac
  operator=match
  value=^00:

To the following

  [condition]
  filter=node_info.mac
  operator=regex
  value=^00:

pf.conf configuration file changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following parameters have been removed from pf.conf. Make sure to remove them from your file if configured.

* alerting.wins_server
* alerting.admin_netbiosname

violations.conf configuration file changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Violations have been reworked and configuration changes are necessary in order to maintain functionnality.

In violations.conf the following actions have been renamed, please update them accordingly.

* trap -> reevaluate_access
* email -> email_admin

The following action have been removed from the violations :

* popup

Also in violations.conf, the parameter whitelisted_categories has been renamed into whitelisted_roles

Billing configuration change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameter `billing_engine` of the Portal Profiles has been deprecated.
Remove it from all your profiles configuration in `/usr/local/pf/conf/profiles.conf`.

The billing engine of PacketFence has been reworked completely.

It will require to reconfigure existing billing providers from scratch as there is no retro-compatibility with the previous configuration.

Please see the Administration Guide for details on how to configure the billing engine.

Mod_qos configuration changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mod_qos configuration has been moved from "services" to "captive_portal" section.
Make sure to apply the appropriate changes if needed.

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.5.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 5.6.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.5.0-5.6.0.sql

Extension points changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file lib/pf/vlan/custom.pm has now been renamed to lib/pf/role/custom.pm.
Most of the customizations that used to be made in vlan/custom.pm can now be handled by configuring a vlan filter.
You should take a good look at your existing vlan/custom.pm and consider porting the changes to conf/vlan_filters.conf. 

VLAN filters changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scopes for the VLAN filters have changed.
The following have been renamed according to these rules:

NormalVlan          -> RegisteredRole
RegistrationVlan    -> RegistrationRole 
ViolationVlan       -> ViolationRole
InlineVlan          -> InlineRole

If you have defined any filters in /usr/local/pf/conf/vlan_filters.conf, make sure to rename all references to the left hand side with the new names on the right hand side.

Default type for the switches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default type for the switches now needs to be set explicitly. Add the following line in the default section of `/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`

`type=Generic`

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.6.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 5.7.0
---------------------------------------

Suricata violation trigger renaming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the introduction of the ability to trigger a violation based on a MD5 hash detected by Suricata, a new trigger type has been introduced, requiring the modification of the actual 'suricata' trigger.
Make sure to go through your violations configuration and change any 'suricata' trigger name for 'suricata_event'.

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.

Make sure you run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.6.0-5.7.0.sql

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 5.7.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 6.0.0
---------------------------------------

Upgrading PacketFence from a version older than v6.0.0 will be a complex undertaking.
While it's entirely possible if done meticulously, we
suggest you start from scratch and move your customizations and
nodes information over to your new installation.


Devices parking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new registration devices parking requires that you add the following violation in `/usr/local/pf/conf/violations.conf`

  [1300003]
  priority=1
  desc=Parking violation
  max_enable=3
  grace=10m
  actions=log,reevaluate_access
  enabled=Y
  auto_enable=Y
  vlan=registration
  trigger=Internal::parking_detected

Chained authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The chained source has been deprecated in favor of a fully customizable flow in the captive portal.

Make sure you delete the source *BEFORE* upgrading your installation.

Once you upgrade, configure a portal module for each of your sources and a chained one that contains both. Refer to the administration guide for a detailed example.

Redesigned captive portal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameter `mandatory_fields` of the Portal Profiles has been deprecated. Remove it from all the profiles in `profiles.conf`

To configure mandatatory fields in the portal, refer to the 'Portal Modules' section of the Administration guide

You need to add the `root_module` parameter to your default portal profile. In `profiles.conf` add `root_module=default_policy` to the default portal profile

Changes to OAuth2 sources callback URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the OAuth2 sources you have configured (Facebook, Github, Google, LinkedIn ,Twitter, Windows Live) need to be adjusted as the redirect URL is now the same for all the types.

In the admin interface change `Portal URL` from `https://YOUR_HOSTNAME/oauth2/SOURCE_TYPE` to `https://YOUR_HOSTNAME/oauth/callback` (where `SOURCE_TYPE` would be the lower case name of the source type). Note that this parameter is named `redirect_url` in the configuration file.

Changes to Cisco Web auth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the Cisco::Catalyst_2960 switch module instead of the Cisco::Catalyst_2960_http as switch type.

Use the Cisco::WLC switch module instead of the Cisco::WLC_http as switch type.

The portalURL configuration parameter is now configured per-role so make sure you have `http://ip_portal/$session_id` assigned to the registration role in the `Role by Web Auth URL` section of the switch configuration.

See the Network Device configuration guide for additional details.

SMS carrier database table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Google Project Fi have been added as a supported carrier. Since an ID is hardcoded on creation of a new entry in the 'sms_carrier' database table, a manual intervention may be required in the case the database schema update fails.

pf.conf configuration parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

'expire' and 'maintenance' section have been reworked and 'expire' section is no longer a thing. Make sure to adjust configuration parameter accordingly if needed;
 
* expire.node is now maintenance.node_cleanup_window
* expire.iplog is now maintenance.iplog_cleanup_window
* expire.locationlog is now maintenance.locationlog_cleanup_window
* expire.radius_audit_log is now maintenance.radius_audit_log_cleanup_window
* expire.traplog is now maintenance.traplog_cleanup_window

node category / role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 'REJECT' role is now a default standard role. If you already have such role, make sure no conflict exists.

Also, add the following line to the default section of `switches.conf` :

`REJECTVlan = -1`

Changes to the generated smb.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a domain configured directly in PacketFence (in 'Configuration->Domains'), you need to re-generate the associated configuration files as changes have been made to the samba configuration.

Using the CLI `/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd generatedomainconfig` or in the admin interface in 'Configuration->Domains', click 'Refresh domain configuration'

Upgrade from FreeRADIUS 2 to FreeRADIUS 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence 6 relies on FreeRADIUS 3 rather that FreeRADIUS 2 as provided in PacketFence 5.
The configuration files, directory layout and "unlang" directives have changed significantly.
The packaging will automatically rename the existing raddb directory to raddb-pre6.
All your existing configuration and certificates (if stored under raddb/certs) should be preserved but may need to be merged with the new raddb directory layout if you customized them.

The configuration files under conf/radiusd/*.example have also changed.
Make sure to compare them to your conf/radiusd/* files if you have any customizations, and merge any *.rpmnew files that may have been created by the packaging.

The default location for the FreeRADIUS server certificates has changed from conf/ssl/ to raddb/certs/.
The configuration of the certificates location is in conf/radiusd/eap.conf.
You may point it to any valid certificate and key by setting the value of `certificate_file` and `private_key_file` respectively.
It is not recommended to use the same server certificate for the HTTP services and the RADIUS server as the requirements for each are different.
Reusing the same certificate will work, but you would be well advised to consider separate certificates.

Finally, the database schema for the RADIUS accounting tables and stored procedures have changed.
Make sure to apply the database changes as described in the following section.

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Significant changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
An SQL upgrade script has been provided to upgrade the database from the 5.7 schema to 6.0.

Since the schema of the `radacct` table has been reworked, the script will rename the existing table to `radacct2` and insert it's content into the new `radacct` table.
If your existing `radacct` table is large (as is sometimes the case), the operation may take a long time and consume a significant amount of disk space.
Make sure to have plenty of both before running the upgrade script.

You can estimate the size of the existing `radacct` table by running the following command:

    mysql> SELECT table_name AS "Table", round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) "Size in MB" FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE table_schema = "pf" AND table_name = "radacct";

You should have at least twice as much space as that table uses in the filesystem on which the MySQL data directory is mounted (usually /var/lib/mysql).

If you do not have enough space or time, you may consider truncating the `radacct` table (or simply deleting some of the rows) before running the upgrade script.

When ready, run the following to update your schema:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-5.7.0-6.0.0.sql

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 6.0.0).

You will also want to drop the `radacct2` table from the database as it will no longer be needed.

Upgrading from a version prior to 6.1.0
---------------------------------------

Significant changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
An SQL upgrade script has been provided to upgrade the database from the 6.0 schema to 6.1.

To upgrade the database schema, run the following command: 

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-6.0.0-6.1.0.sql

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 6.1.0).


Dynamically created local secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The management IP(s) of PacketFence are now defined as switches with a forced RADIUS secret defined in /usr/local/pf/conf/local_secret. Make sure you reconfigure the secret in the file if necessary and that this file is synchronized on all your cluster members if that applies. Note that this doesn't affect the RADIUS secret you have configured for wireless controllers and switches. It only affects RADIUS requests that originate from the management IP(s)

Changes to LinkedIn source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A change to the authorize URL of LinkedIn was made. Make sure to change the 'API Authorize Path' in all your LinkedIn source to `/uas/oauth2/authorization`.

Upgrading from a version prior to 6.2.0
---------------------------------------

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
An SQL upgrade script has been provided to upgrade the database from the 6.1 schema to 6.2.

To upgrade the database schema, run the following command: 

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-6.1.0-6.2.0.sql

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 6.2.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 6.2.1
---------------------------------------

Changes have been made to the httpd.admin configuration.
Make sure you copy the conf/httpd.conf.d/httpd.admin.tt.example file over conf/httpd.conf.d/httpd.admin.tt.
If you customized that file in any way, you will have to merge the changes.

Restart the httpd.admin process once that is done by running 
  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service httpd.admin restart

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 6.2.1).

Upgrading from a version prior to 6.3.0
---------------------------------------

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
An SQL upgrade script has been provided to upgrade the database from the 6.2 schema to 6.3.

To upgrade the database schema, run the following command: 

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-6.2.0-6.3.0.sql

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 6.3.0).

RADIUS configuration file changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following file: /usr/local/pf/conf/radiusd/eap.conf was modified to use TemplateToolkit, you will need to replace it by /usr/local/pf/conf/radiusd/eap.conf.example, make sure to re-edit the new file and add your certificate if needed.

Samba cache directory changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rejoining the domains from PacketFence GUI is required. 

Go under `Configuration->RADIUS->Domains` and click `Rejoin` for each domain configured.

Configuration changes to the Provisioning and Scaning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration of the Scan engines and the Provisioners has been reworked to use the Fingerbank device IDs in the OS matching. `scan.conf` and `provisioning.conf` need to be migrated to use the new values. A migration script should be run `# /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-6.3-os-rewrite.pl` to migrate the configuration. This will output the migrated configuration in `/usr/local/pf/conf/provisioning.conf.new` and `/usr/local/pf/conf/scan.conf.new`. First run the script and then validate that their content is fine. Once that is done, copy the files over the original ones using : 

```
# cp /usr/local/pf/conf/provisioning.conf.new /usr/local/pf/conf/provisioning.conf
# cp /usr/local/pf/conf/scan.conf.new /usr/local/pf/conf/scan.conf
# /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard
```

Fingerbank database moving to MySQL (optionnal but highly suggested)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Fingerbank database can now be hosted in the same MySQL database PacketFence uses.

In order to do so, you need to collect the database credentials from the PacketFence configuration:

```
# /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd pfconfig show resource::Database
$VAR1 = {
          'pass' => 'myPassword',
          'db' => 'pf',
          'user' => 'pf',
          'port' => '3306',
          'host' => 'localhost'
        };
```

Now, you need to create the database and assign the proper rights to the user by executing the following commands:

```
# mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE pf_fingerbank"
# mysql -u root -p -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pf_fingerbank.* TO 'pf'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'myPassword'"
# mysql -u root -p -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pf_fingerbank.* TO 'pf'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'myPassword'"
```

Replace `myPassword` by the password displayed (`pass`) when running the first command.

Next, head to 'Configuration->Fingerbank Settings' in the web administration interface and configure the following parameters:

 * MySQL host : set this to the value of `host` you got from running the command above.
 * MySQL port : set this to the value of `port` you got from running the command above.
 * MySQL username : set this to the value of `user` you got from running the command above.
 * MySQL password : set this to the value of `pass` you got from running the command above.
 * MySQL database : set this to `pf_fingerbank`.
 
After saving those new parameters, at the top of the same page, click 'Initialize MySQL database' to start the import process. Once that is completed, you will receive an e-mail to the one configured for alerting and PacketFence will start using the MySQL backend for the Fingerbank database.

Upgrading from a version prior to 6.4.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
An SQL upgrade script has been provided to upgrade the database from the 6.3 schema to 6.4.

To upgrade the database schema, run the following command: 

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-6.3.0-6.4.0.sql


Changes to web authentication configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rework of the external captive portal capabilities involves some significant changes in the switch modules configuration.
Some switch modules have been moved to other ones and some others have been removed. Please adjust the configuration (type) accordingly within switches.conf.

 * AeroHIVE::AP_http -> AeroHIVE::AP
 * Meraki::AP_http -> Meraki::MR
 * Meraki::AP_http_V2 -> Meraki::MR_v2
 * Xirrus:AP_http -> Xirrus

To instruct a switch module to perform external captive portal enforcement, a new switch configuration parameter have been added. Make sure to adjust the following parameter to your needs in switches.conf

```
ExternalPortalEnforcement = Y
```

External captive portal URLs have also changed. Change them accordingly depending on the type of equipment you use:

 * AeroHIVE: http://portal_IP/AeroHIVE::AP
 * Aruba: http://portal_IP/Aruba
 * Cisco Catalyst 2960: http://portal_IP/Cisco::Catalyst_2960
 * Cisco WLC: http://portal_IP/Cisco::WLC
 * CoovaChilli: http://portal_IP/CoovaChilli
 * Meraki: http://portal_IP/Meraki::MR
 * Ruckus: http://portal_IP/Ruckus
 * Xirrus: http://portal_IP/Xirrus

Where portal_ip is the IP Address (or DNS name) of your captive portal as it was configured before


Changes to WMI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use WMI, you must modify conf/wmi.conf in order to make sure that a namespace parameter is defined for each rule. For example, you could have:

```
[SCCM]
request=select * from Win32_Process where name='CcmExec.exe'
action=[sccm]
namespace=ROOT\cimv2
on_tab=1
```

Changes to default cronjob
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon PacketFence installation, a default cronjob will be in /etc/cron.d/. You should make sure you do not invoke the /usr/local/pf/addons/database-backup-and-maintenance.sh
script from any other cronjob.

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 6.4.0).


Upgrading from a version prior to 6.5.0
---------------------------------------

Database schema updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
An SQL upgrade script has been provided to upgrade the database from the 6.4 schema to 6.5.

To upgrade the database schema, run the following command: 

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-6.4.0-6.5.0.sql


Custom code warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method signature of pf::node::node_register has been modified. Make sure you adjust any custom code / external scripts to handle the new returned values.

Switches Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You must rename "controllerPort" to "disconnectPort" in your switches.conf configuration file. You can automate this using:

  cd /usr/local/pf
  find . -name "switches.conf" -exec sed -i "s/controllerPort/disconnectPort/g" '{}' \;

Eduroam
^^^^^^^
Eduroam authentication source is now an "exclusive" authentication source rather than an "external" one. That being said, make sure to adjust portal profile accordingly (an "exclusive" authentication source can be the only one configured in a portal profile).

Improved Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to be sure all your logging facilities use the new logging backend which ensures the processes will not die in case of a logging failure, you must execute the following command:

  cd /usr/local/pf
  find conf/log.conf.d/ -type f -exec sed -i.bak "s/Log::Log4perl::Appender::File/pf::log::FileAppender/g" {} \; ; find conf/log.conf.d/ -name '*.bak' -delete

Email templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The email templates have been moved from /usr/local/pf/conf/emails/ to /usr/local/pf/html/captive-portal/templates/emails/ as they are now configurable by portal profile. Also you can configure the language in which PacketFence should send emails to the administrator in the Advanced section of the configuration.

Make sure you run the following command after upgrading:

  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd cache configfiles clear

Violations
^^^^^^^^^^
When whitelisting roles in a violation, the registration role will now match unregistered devices where before it would never match. Make sure to go through violations that may include this role to make sure it is relevant.

Database schema updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The "configfile" and "traplog" database tables are now deprecated. If you wish to reclaim the disk space used by those two database tables, they should be manually removed.

Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 6.5.0).


Default RoleMap for the switches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you were using the default 'RoleMap = Y' in the conf/switches.conf it's disabled by default now. You will need to put 'RoleMap = Y' under your switches or switch group configuration.

Upgrading from a version prior to 7.0.0
---------------------------------------

NOTE: You cannot upgrade from CentOS 6 or Debian Wheezy to PacketFence 7.0 and above

Debian upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The requirement for MariaDB 10.1 means that a simple "apt upgrade" will not be enough.
You will need to help apt through the upgrade by manually removing some packages and installing some others.
The need to ensure you have backups cannot be overstated.

Make sure the apt database is up to date

    apt update

Remove the MySQL 5.5 packages (do not purge them, as that would delete the database)

    dpkg -r --force-all mysql-client-5.5 mysql-common mysql-server mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server-core-5.5 libmysqlclient18

Install the newer Mariadb-10.1 packages

    apt install libmariadbclient18 libmysqlclient18 mariadb-common mariadb-server-10.1 galera-3 gawk mariadb-client-10.1 mariadb-server-core-10.1 rsync socat libmpfr4 mariadb-client-core-10.1 mysql-common

Finally, upgrade the rest of the packages

    apt full-upgrade

Note that "full-upgrade" may also affect other packages you might have installed on the system if you had other software than PacketFence on it.

MariaDB upgrade (CentOS + RHEL only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrading to PacketFence 7+ will install a more recent version of MariaDB than the one that is shipped with CentOS.

In order to upgrade the MariaDB metadata files and tables, first stop any started process.

  systemctl stop mariadb
  systemctl stop packetfence-mariadb
  
Then start a mysqld_safe process manually (this will start a background process)
  
  mkdir -p /var/run/mariadb
  chown mysql: /var/run/mariadb
  mysqld_safe --basedir=/usr &
 
Then, execute the upgrade script and enter the root password when prompted
  
  mysql_upgrade -u root -p
  
When done, kill the mysqld_safe process we started before the update, reattach to it and wait for it to exit

  kill %1 && fg
  
Note that it might take up to a few minutes for the process to exit depending on the size of your database.

Once done, restart the MariaDB service (managed by PacketFence)

  systemctl start packetfence-mariadb

Database schema update (all Linux distributions)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes have been made to the database schema. You will need to update it accordingly.
An SQL upgrade script has been provided to upgrade the database from the 6.5 schema to 7.0.

To upgrade the database schema, run the following command:

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < /usr/local/pf/db/upgrade-6.5.0-7.0.0.sql

Systemd integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All PacketFence services are managed individually via systemd unit files instead of one unit file (`packetfence.service`). When you updated the PacketFence package, it already set the system target to `packetfence.target`.

If you are hosting the MySQL/MariaDB service on your PacketFence servers (it is by default), you should now manage the service via `packetfence-mariadb.service` instead of `mariadb.service`.
The changes in the server startup will be done automatically by the packaging.

Admin roles configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the portal profiles have now been renamed to connection profiles, you need to make sure any admin role that allowed portal profile Create/Read/Update/Delete operations is updated to be valid for connection profiles.

  cd /usr/local/pf
  sed -i "s/PORTAL_PROFILE/CONNECTION_PROFILE/g" conf/adminroles.conf

PacketFence configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple parameters inside `pf.conf` have been renamed for better clarity. Execute the following in order to migrate the parameters.

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-7.0-pf-conf-changes.pl

Maintenance configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maintenance related configuration for pfmon has been moved to a dedicated configuration file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/pfmon.conf`).

In order to migrate your settings from `pf.conf` to `pfmon.conf`, run the following script:

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-7.0-pf.conf-to-pfmon.conf.pl

DHCP filters configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor changes were made to the DHCP filters configuration (`/usr/local/pf/conf/dhcp_filters.conf`).

First, the `computer_name` attribute was renamed to `computername` to be consistent with the rest of the application.
Then, the `DhcpFingerbank` scope was changed to `Fingerbank`

In order to rename those in an automated way:

  cd /usr/local/pf
  sed -i "s/computer_name/computername/g" conf/dhcp_filters.conf
  sed -i "s/DhcpFingerbank/Fingerbank/g" conf/dhcp_filters.conf

Roles configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The source of truth for roles is now in a configuration file (`/usr/local/pf/conf/roles.conf`) instead of being in the database. In order to pull the existing roles from your database into the configuration file, execute the following command:

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-7.0-roles-conf.pl

NOTE: The roles still exist in the database like before (node_category table), but their source of truth is now in the configuration file. Should you remove a role manually from `roles.conf`, it will *not* be removed from the database unless you manually go delete it from the database.

pfdetect configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New parameters have been introduced in `conf/pfdetect.conf`. Run the following script to migrate your configuration.

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-7.0-pfdetect-conf.pl

LinkedIn Source changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using the LinkedIn OAuth2 source, a change has been made on their API, thus you will need to do the following:

  cd /usr/local/pf
  sed -i "s/uas\/oauth2/oauth\/v2/g" conf/authentication.conf


Logging service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since all logging now goes through rsyslog, if you had edited the logging configuration (e.g. to forward logs to a centralized syslog server) make sure that the new logging rules in `/etc/rsyslog.d/packetfence.conf` do not conflict with your changes.

Take a look at `/usr/local/pf/conf/log.conf` and `/usr/local/pf/conf/log.conf.d/*` for the detailed configuration of the PacketFence services.

Redis Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^

Clear the redis queue to avoid old stale jobs from being processes.


  systemctl start packetfence-redis_queue
  redis-cli -p 6380 FLUSHALL
  systemctl stop packetfence-redis_queue
  
SSL certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given that haproxy is now the termination point for the captive portal, any SSL configuration you have in `/usr/local/pf/conf/httpd.conf.d/ssl-certificates.conf` needs to be ported so that it works with haproxy.

Easiest solution is to bundle your server cert, your intermediates (if any) along with the key in the default file used by the PacketFence haproxy process (`/usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/server.pem`)

In order to do so:

  # cd /usr/local/pf/
  # cat /path/to/your/server.crt /path/to/your/intermediates.crt /path/to/your/server.key > /usr/local/pf/conf/ssl/server.pem

Running 7.0+ in a cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A complete re-visit of the database clustering stack was done in version 7.0. If you run your PacketFence installation in a cluster, make sure you read the following section.

Active/Active clusters with Active/Passive DB (default before 7.0)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We highly suggest you migrate your existing clustered installation using Corosync/Pacemaker to the new cluster stack of PacketFence that uses MariaDB Galera cluster. 
The easiest way to perform this is to build new servers and port your configuration (by copying the configuration files) and your database (using mysqldump).
There are ways to migrate the 2 existing nodes to a 3 nodes cluster but this is not covered in this guide.

*Corosync adjustment*

Note that you can safely keep your existing 2-node cluster with Corosync/Pacemaker in place and things will work like before.
You will simply have to adjust your Corosync configuration so that MariaDB points to the packetfence-mariadb file instead of the mariadb unit.

  primitive MariaDB systemd:packetfence-mariadb \
          op start timeout=60s interval=0 \
          op stop timeout=60s interval=0 \
          op monitor interval=20s timeout=30s
	 
*Disabling Galera cluster*

You must then disable the MariaDB Galera cluster as a replication mechanism as you will still be using DRBD. In order to do so, add the following in `/usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf`

  [active_active]
  galera_replication=disabled
 
*IP address bind*

You must also instruct packetfence-mariadb to bind to the management IP address of the server manually.

In order to do so, replace the following section in `/usr/local/pf/conf/mariadb/mariadb.conf.tt`:

  [% IF server_ip.length %]
  bind-address=[% server_ip %]
  [% ELSE %]
  skip-networking
  bind-address=
  [% END %]

with:
  bind-address=1.2.3.4

Where 1.2.3.4 is the management IP address of the server.

*Disable packetfence-mariadb on boot*

Like in previous versions where mariadb shouldn't have been started on boot, now you must ensure its replacement (packetfence-mariadb) doesn't start on boot.

  systemctl disable packetfence-mariadb
  
*Enabling the packetfence-cluster target*

Next, you must set the default target to packetfence-cluster:

  systemctl set-default packetfence-cluster.target

Active/Active clusters with external DB
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

No changes to your clustering stack is required when using an external database.

Active/Passive clusters
+++++++++++++++++++++++

CAUTION: You shouldn't be running active/passive clusters anymore. If you do, you're pretty much on your own for community support. Inverse provides professionnal services to help you maintain these clusters. If you intend to keep an active/passive cluster, we suggest you have deep knowledge of Corosync/Pacemaker and strong Linux skills.

First, no changes are required to your database stack as MariaDB supports being deployed in Active/Passive.

You will need to adjust the Corosync/Pacemaker configuration to take in consideration the changes made to systemd for PacketFence services. Before 7.0, PacketFence used to be controlled via a single systemd unit file while now it uses a multiple services grouped in targets. In order to mimic the single service behavior that was in previous versions, a unit file is provided here: https://github.com/inverse-inc/packetfence/blob/devel/packetfence-active-passive.service. You should install this file in `/etc/systemd/system/packetfence.service` and make sure there are no other leftovers of `packetfence.service` unit files on your system.

Then, you must adjust the systemd default target so PacketFence doesn't start on boot and note that this should be done on every future upgrade of your system.

  # systemctl set-default multi-user.target

You should then change your Corosync configuration for MariaDB and PacketFence to the following:

	primitive MariaDB systemd:packetfence-mariadb \
	        op start timeout=60s interval=0 \
	        op stop timeout=60s interval=0 \
	        op monitor interval=20s timeout=30s
	primitive PacketFence systemd:packetfence \
	        op start timeout=300s interval=0 \
	        op stop timeout=300s interval=0 \
	        op monitor interval=300s timeout=300s

Upgrading from a version prior to 7.1.0
---------------------------------------

Multiple DNS servers per domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PacketFence Active Directory Domains integration now supports multiple DNS servers to be specified to find a DC. For this reason the parameter dns_server has been renamed to dns_servers in domain.conf. In order to automatically rename the parameters, run the following command:

    sed -i.bak "s/^dns_server/dns_servers/g" /usr/local/pf/conf/domain.conf

Ability to «pin» a domain DC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence is now able to instruct Samba to «pin» a DC for authentication or use all of them.
You should instruct Samba to connect to all domain controllers by adding the following to each of your domains in domain.conf:

  sticky_dc=*
  
And then regenerate the domain configuration:

  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd fixpermissions
  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd configreload hard
  /usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd generatedomainconfig

Change to sponsor CC address

Changes to `authentication.conf` and `domain.conf` regarding realms and source matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have to run the following script to change the configuration:

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-7.3-authentication-conf.pl

MariaDB database read-only mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There was, in some cases, an issue where the database cluster was put in a read-only mode which then prevent it to comes back gracefully.

A modification have been made to now use the wsrep_ready state of the DB as a read only indicator. Therefore, PacketFence will stop putting the DB in read only on quorum + primary loss of MariaDB and trust wsrep_ready instead

Ensure you merge changes in the galera section of `conf/mariadb/mariadb.conf.tt.rpmnew` into `conf/mariadb/mariadb.conf.tt`


Once completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number (PacketFence 7.3.0).

Upgrading from a version prior to 8.0.0
---------------------------------------

Realms upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The way PacketFence detects whether or not it should strip the realm out of a username when performing authentication and authorisation has been moved to the realms. Moreover, it is now configurable based on the context (login on the captive portal or administration interface, as well as when performing authorization in RADIUS 802.1x)

In order to migrate your configuration, you can use the following script which will guide you through the migration:

 /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-8.0-authentication-conf.pl

Fingerbank v2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Device names*

Packetfence now uses Fingerbank v2 for improved device profiling. Since this new version brings new device names, a rename of the previous data is necessary.

In order to do so, execute the following script:

 /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-8.0-fingerbank-db-data.pl

*Necessary API key*

Fingerbank doesn't release its signature database anymore and has moved to an API centric approach for device profiling. In order for device profiling to keep working on your installation, you must make sure that there is an API key configured for Fingerbank in your PacketFence installation.

In order to do so, you should make sure you have the following in `/usr/local/fingerbank/conf/fingerbank.conf`

NOTE: In order to request an API key, you can visit the following URL: https://api.fingerbank.org/users/register

```
[upstream]
api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE
```

WARNING: Fingerbank v1 and v2 *do not* use the same infrastructure. The accounts (API keys) created on fingerbank.inverse.ca before the 8.0 release have been migrated to api.fingerbank.org. Still, you should make sure that you have the correct API key configured in fingerbank.conf by looking at your profile on https://api.fingerbank.org/users/register. If you have a corporate account, then you can safely assume its been migrated, you can email fingerbank@inverse.ca for a confirmation. If you use a Github account and you have tried Fingerbank v2 prior to the PacketFence 8.0 release, *then your API key will be different*. Make sure you update fingerbank.conf in that case.

If you manage a large scale environment, you'll want to make sure your account can perform an unlimited amount of API requests on Fingerbank so that device profiling works correctly in a consistent way. In order to obtain this, contact fingerbank@inverse.ca. Note that most Inverse customers are entitled to free unlimited usage of the Fingerbank Cloud API.

Changes to the default switch roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default roles that were returned using "Role by Switch Role" have been removed. If you were relying on them to be returned in the RADIUS response, then you need to add them back in the default switch in the 'Roles' tab.

The previous values were:

 * `registration`: `registration`
 * `isolation`: `isolation`
 * `macDetection`: `macDetection`
 * `inline`: `inline`
 * `voice`: `voice`

This is should only be necessary if you are using ACL assignment on your switches and using the default names that were there in PacketFence before.

Removal of the graphite database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence doesn't use graphite anymore for its dashboard. It is recommended to delete the graphite database although this is purely optional.

In order to do so, execute the following:

  mysql -u root -p -e "drop database pf_graphite"

Changes to DNS filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The $qname parameter need to be removed from dns_filters.conf 

In order to do so, execute the following command:

  sed -i -e 's/\$qname//g' /usr/local/pf/conf/dns_filters.conf

Database schema update (all Linux distributions)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The queue_stats maintenance job has been deprecated in favor of using pfstats. In order to remove configuration related to this maintenance job, run:

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-8.2-pfmon-conf.pl

Upgrade pfdetect perl regex to the go RE2 regex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The pfdetect was moved from perl to go so all rule regexes have to be converted to the RE2 regex syntax.
RE2 is mostly is compatiable the perl regex syntax.
More information on the RE2 syntax can be found here https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.
To upgrade the regex run:

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-8.2-pfdetect-conf.pl

Any perl regex that cannnot be convert will be displayed and should be fixed.

Upgrade realm.conf to be tenant aware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The realms are now multi-tenant aware, in order to upgrade your configuration to have the existing realms use the default tenant, execute the following script:

  /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-8.2-realm-conf.pl


The api_user table has been deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any users in that were in the api_user table should be migrated to PacketFence local account (password table)

Upgrade pf user privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from 8.2, stored routines will be dump *with* the PacketFence database.
The user created at the installation ('pf' by default) in database need to
have additional privileges to do that task.

To upgrade the privileges of that user, run the following command:

 /usr/local/pf/addons/upgrade/to-8.2-upgrade-pf-privileges.sh

Update connection_type from WIRED_MAC_AUTH to Ethernet-NoEAP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We merged the WIRED_MAC_AUTH and Ethernet-NoEAP to Ethernet-NoEAP so the configuration needs to be updated, to do that run:

 sed -i "s/WIRED_MAC_AUTH/Ethernet-NoEAP/g" /usr/local/pf/conf/profiles.conf /usr/local/pf/conf/vlan_filters.conf /usr/local/pf/conf/radius_filters.conf /usr/local/pf/conf/switch_filters.conf /usr/local/pf/conf/authentication.conf
