Please note, Github issues are for reporting/tracking DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. For anything related to getting help in running PacketFence, or anything else not related to DEVELOPMENT, please use the [mailing-list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/packetfence-users).

## How to properly file an issue.
* Please make sure to properly describe the issue / feature and label it accordingly.
* No need for a novel but it should explain how to replicate if required to, otherwise give the big picture.
