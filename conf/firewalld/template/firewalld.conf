# IPv6_rpfilter
# Performs a reverse path filter test on a packet for IPv6. If a reply to the
# packet would be sent via the same interface that the packet arrived on, the 
# packet will match and be accepted, otherwise dropped.
# The rp_filter for IPv4 is controlled using sysctl.
# Note: This feature has a performance impact. See man page FIREWALLD.CONF(5)

# LogDenied
# Add logging rules right before reject and drop rules in the INPUT, FORWARD

# FlushAllOnReload
# Flush all runtime rules on a reload. In previous releases some runtime

# AllowZoneDrifting
# Older versions of firewalld had undocumented behavior known as "zone
# drifting". This allowed packets to ingress multiple zones - this is a
# violation of zone based firewalls. However, some users rely on this behavior
# to have a "catch-all" zone, e.g. the default zone. You can enable this if you
# desire such behavior. It's disabled by default for security reasons.
# Note: If "yes" packets will only drift from source based zones to interface
# based zones (including the default zone). Packets never drift from interface
# based zones to other interfaces based zones (including the default zone).
# Possible values; "yes", "no". Defaults to "yes".
