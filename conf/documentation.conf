If enabled, PacketFence will monitor DHCP-specific items such as rogue 
DHCP services, DHCP-based OS fingerprinting, computername/hostname 
resolution, and (optionnally) option-82 location-based information. 
The monitored DHCP packets are DHCPDISCOVERs and DHCPREQUESTs - both 
are broadcasts, meaning a span port is not necessary.  This feature is 
highly recommended if the internal network is DHCP-based.
EOT

[network.dhcp_rate_limiting]
type=time
description=<<EOT
Will rate-limit DHCP packets that contain the same information.
For example, a DHCPREQUEST for the same MAC/IP will only be processed once in the timeframe configured below.
This is independant of the DHCP server/relay handling the packet and is only based on the IP, MAC Address and DHCP type inside the packet.
A value of 0 will disable the rate limitation.

type=text
description=<<EOT
Ports to intercept and redirect for trapped and unregistered systems.  Defaults 
to 80/tcp (HTTP), 443/tcp (HTTPS). Redirecting 443/tcp (SSL) will work, 
although users might get certificate errors if you didn't install a valid 
certificate or if you don't use DNS (although IP-based certificates supposedly 
exist). 
Redirecting 53/udp (DNS) seems to have issues and is also not recommended.

[captive_portal.loadbalancers_ip]
type=text
description=<<EOT
If the captive portal is put behind load-balancer(s) that act at Layer 7 
(HTTP level) effectively doing reverse proxying then the captive portal no 
longer sees the IP of the node trying to access the portal. In that case, 
the load-balancers must do SSL offloading and add a X-Forwarded-By header 
in the HTTP traffic they forward to PacketFence. Most do by default. Then 
in this parameter you must specify the IP of the various load balancers. 
This will instruct the captive portal to look for client IPs in the 
X-Forwarded-For instead of the actual TCP session when it matches an IP 
in the list. Format is a comma separated list of IPs. Note: Apache access 
log format is not changed to automatically log the X-Forwarded-By header. 
Modify conf/httpd.conf.d/captive-portal-common.conf to use 
load balanced combined instead of combined in CustomLog statement.
