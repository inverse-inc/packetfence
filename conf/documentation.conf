highly recommended if the internal network is DHCP-based.

[captive_portal.loadbalancers_ip]
type=text
description=<<EOT
If the captive portal is put behind load-balancer(s) that act at Layer 7 
(HTTP level) effectively doing reverse proxying then the captive portal no 
longer sees the IP of the node trying to access the portal. In that case, 
the load-balancers must do SSL offloading and add a X-Forwarded-By header 
in the HTTP traffic they forward to PacketFence. Most do by default. Then 
in this parameter you must specify the IP of the various load balancers. 
This will instruct the captive portal to look for client IPs in the 
X-Forwarded-For instead of the actual TCP session when it matches an IP 
in the list. Format is a comma separated list of IPs. Note: Apache access 
log format is not changed to automatically log the X-Forwarded-By header. 
Modify conf/httpd.conf.d/captive-portal-common.conf to use 
loadbalanced_combined instead of combined in CustomLog statement.
