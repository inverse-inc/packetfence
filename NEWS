1.4.4

Clean up of the pf modules directory

UI nessus addition

The packetfence.spec file has been tweaked alot make sure uninstall is clean.

documentation.conf is now included 

regex bug in violations.conf fixed

new logic to install correct snort  (fixes old FC3 library error)

upgraded mysql to 4.1 (fixes another FC3 bug) 

changed installer/spec file package deps and installer doc. 
misc installer cleanup.  

added nessus modules and dependencies to installer

Apache/PHP was bombing on FC3 - changed PHP handler and enabled 
pf/session dir for session handling.
 
fixed bug where apache auth config was appended even if registration 
was disabled.

changed default value of named to "disabled".

changed stuffing to disabled.

deleted default expiry_window and window values. 

added msdownload SSL proxy crap.  

changed iptables log messages to clarify passthrough.

fixed problem where *all* violations were adding iptables rules, 
not just those with trap actions.  

pf.conf defaults to using a non-root account (user will need to edit 
account/password - I didn't bother doing that) and installer creates 
one.  installer creates admin GUI account (ships with no admin.conf)
